When I've then opened 0.8.9, it's as if I never used the previous version: it's asking me to set passwords for accounts, and it's downloading all the blocks. <SEP> @willnwhite ok i understand now - that is surprising!  I am not a user of ethereum wallet so can't help you :( <SEP> @3esmit I still have my password, so I'm hoping if I can find the keys I can get my accounts back. <SEP> Is there an application whose job it is to hold on to cryptocurrency keys? <SEP> wallets are supposed to do that :) <SEP> Right! It seems though that they should be separate concerns. <SEP> The way that a password manager is separate to a browser. <SEP> well sort of, there is a JSON representation of an ethereum account (private key) that is widely used (geth uses it - probably ethereum wallet does too) <SEP> since it is in a file, you can easily . back it up and move it between different apps <SEP> another option is using a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s <SEP> It seems that upgrading Ethereum Wallet has wiped the keys. So it makes sense that a wallet application shouldn't handle them at all. <SEP> i am surprised that upgrading it wiped them... <SEP> Because the focus of a wallet application upgrade will not necessarily be on preserving the keys, rather some other functionality that wallets have. <SEP> other apps don't do that <SEP> well the whole point of a wallet is to manage your keys <SEP> But wallets also connect to the network etc.. <SEP> i see your point but its not so cut and dry <SEP> if you had a ""wallet manager"" which only managed keys <SEP> and a ""separate app"" that talked to the wallet manager when it needed keys <SEP> you would need to secure the connection between the app and the wallet manager <SEP> to avoid exposing private keys <SEP> and that has all sorts of issues <SEP> so it seems that the keys themselves are portable <SEP> and can be moved between apps <SEP> and the apps usually have import/export functionality for keys <SEP> so its up to the user to manage them mostly <SEP> but - what you describe with ethereum wallet sounds REALLY unusual, i am surprised it did what you describe!!! <SEP> upgrading an app shiould never lose the keys <SEP> and to clarify terminoklogy - a wallet protects a single private key <SEP> what you are describing sounds like a wallet manager <SEP> Password managers must have solved this problem though. <SEP> I'm trying to find out where the keys may be stored on my computer (Mac OS X).",how can i download ethereum wallet?

I don't know all the details of how the Ethereum node works, but here's my current understanding of it:  When I run Ethereum node (Parity) on OSX via docker I need to expose the following ports:      8545, 8456 - that's for json rpc (I guess)      8080, 8180 - that's for ui (I guess)      30303 (tcp+udp) - that's for p2p connections (I guess)  Looks like these ports are open for inbound connections on MacOS by default. Looks like if somebody has an access to json-rpc nodes they can attack the node by smth like ""execute transaction as soon as someone unlocks the wallet"". Also it looks like that it sort of cannot be done when node is run locally just because of Internet Service Provider doesn't expose your IP address to the internet.  So I'm kind of confused and would appreciate if someone clarify at least some of these questions:  1) Are the descriptions above accurate?  2) While I don't have public IP, there are still some connections by peer nodes active. How's that possible? Will these peers be able to connect to json-rpc ports and use node api?  3) What are good security measures to run node safely? Block any 8xxx port for inbound connections? Maybe there's a good guide for it?  4) What information is available to somebody who can connect to node? All eth accounts, but they're locked, so until somebody supply a password they can't do anything?  5) If someone steals json keystore - is it possible to unlock it without knowing the password (assuming good password difficulty) <SEP> @alleycat-at-git   yes, but these are are only accessible to localhost by default. only 30303 is outbound. Having an open rpc is a huge security risk. Lots of ETH stolen this way. People could access all functions specified in --rpcapi. Including sending tx when the wallet is unlocked. Unlocking the wallet requires the pw since the keyfile is encrypted with the pw <SEP> @alleycat-at-git  Perhaps this could guide you https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3887/how-to-reduce-the-chances-of-your-ethereum-wallet-getting-hacked  In case you are interested/intent to have Nginx as reverse-proxy server to connect to the nodes via SSL/TLS for Ethereum JSON-RPC-API, this is also good ... https://tokenmarket.net/blog/protecting-ethereum-json-rpc-api-with-password/",how to install ethereum in redhat linux

How they say that the bids are hidden, if anyone can see the state and the transaction history in the blockchain? <SEP> I would like to understand what I have to do to start using ethereum <SEP> @Aminadav You have to hash your data. <SEP> If it hashed how ENS contract, knows who is the winner? <SEP> @Aminadav It works off the hashes and you submit the value that was hashed to prove you're the hash. <SEP> I'm understand. I read this  <SEP> Is it mean that someone can cancel my `domain`? <SEP> @thiruthuvarajan_twitter A blockchain is a database of it's own. apparently, MongoDB offers a blockchain version of itself. That's not related to Ehereum though. <SEP> And Ethereum uses it's own blockchain software IIRC <SEP> @Aminadav No <SEP> A smart contract is REST <SEP> It only does stuff when told to do stuff <SEP> So if a domain is no longer valid, yet the contract thinks it is because it never checked, and someone points that out, they can collect a fee <SEP> OK. I'm understand. invalidate a domain that is no valid. Thx <SEP> @kayabaNerve  many thanks :) Where can I download this IIRC :worried: <SEP> IIRC? That means ""If I recall correctly"" <SEP> Ethereum's code is on Github <SEP> MongoDB is also on Github IIRC <SEP> I have never used MongoDB and can't help you with that <SEP> I would recommend going to a MongoDB chat channel <SEP> For Ethereum, you can get Geth and easily create a fake network by using a new genesis block <SEP> But as Mongo DB can handle a variety of data. Ethereum handles balances of users, program code, and storage found in contracts <SEP> So MongoDB is what you want for a personal general purpose blockchain <SEP> why ENS is loading dictionary? What is this dictionary? <SEP> But again, that's best discussed in a MongoDB place <SEP> @Aminadav Used for hashes IIRC <SEP> You know Mnemonic keys? <SEP> @kayabaNerve  Thanks a lot . :) I will check :+1: <SEP> How is it realted to here? <SEP> Those are used to represent data in a easier to use way <SEP> I'm pretty sure ENS does the same thing <SEP> When you register for an ENS, you use words as a secret key <SEP> check it out on MyEtherWallet (no need to actually open an auction; just act like you will) <SEP> ok. what is ""open without bidding"", I'm not understand that button <SEP> They are not explaining that button <SEP> LOL It's beta software made for technical people <SEP> I'm a technical guy, navigate my way in the Ether' world. <SEP> Then you should understand that the docs aren't complete for whatever reason and either ask an ENS group or go look yourself <SEP> I'm not complaining. I'm asking here :) <SEP> I never said you were complaining :P <SEP> ""Then you should understand..."" sounds like... <SEP> Who are you?

Summarization," <SEP> Hi guys <SEP> I'd like to help some people. <SEP> hello  andrew <SEP> i am new to ethereum and will ethereum take over bitcoin?when all are busy buying bitcoins? <SEP> I don't work for Ethereum, I've only been using it for a day or so, but I'd like to help. <SEP> Ethereum has the support of major companies like Microsoft and VISA <SEP> yes ,i am just looking for opinions and help. <SEP> Ethereum is very different than bitcoin. <SEP> different as if?can we invest in it as of bitcoin? <SEP> You can invest in it. The investment is different, though. The differences are good and very promising. <SEP> can you guide me for same investing in it and knowing more about it <SEP> If you look at the website, Ethereum.org, you'll notice that they use the word platform. They call ethereum a platform. Bitcoin is currency while Ethereum is a platform. <SEP> okay <SEP> When you hear the word platform, or digital platform, you probably think of something like ""Google"" or ""Windows"" -- and that is a good way to think about it. <SEP> What the ""Ethereum Platform"" does is similar to gas, or oil. Just as you have a car and the car uses gas -- you can have a ""program"" or a ""website"" that is powered by ethereum. <SEP> The value of ethereum has gone up 3700% this year. It is only 2 years old I think. <SEP> Programs and websites are being made, right now, that are powered by Ethereum. Microsoft and VISA are making software on it. <SEP> Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a number. It works very similarly, but  you cannot have a bitcoin powered anything. You can only have the number and exchange a number of bitcoin. <SEP> how buying ethereum will serve  us ,as for making monetary gains?cant it be like we buy ethereum and keep it as in locking period and make gains by selling it as prices rises?can it be done? <SEP> Yes. It can be done. The value of ethereum will go up with more popularity. <SEP> In 1 day, more ethereum is transferred than all other coins combined. Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, iota coin, all of them combined are used less than ethereum is in a 24 hour period and ethereum. <SEP> where we can buy them? <SEP> is there any app like zebpay? <SEP> Are you familiar with ""Wallets""? <SEP> kind of stuff authorised and genuiune one? <SEP> is there something like shapeshift but with larger volumes? <SEP> yes wallets <SEP> Do you have a wallet for ethereum? <SEP> no i have one for bitcoin i.e zebpay <SEP> I'm unfamiliar with bitcoin. I am very familiar with ethereum. I will help you. <SEP> yes thanks for that i am more inclined for ethereum as of now <SEP> which wallet do you have for ethereum? <SEP> With Ethereum, you have a wallet. A wallet is similar to a bank account number. The wallet has a public ""account address"" and a private ""account password"", both are very long. You do not need to use a website for them. They are not saved on a website. <SEP> Every ethereum wallet is the same. The wallet is an address and a password. <SEP> ok so how one can get that wallet and more about that. <SEP> https://www.myetherwallet.com/ Use this website to create a (1) password,  (2) address, and (3) private-key... Save the password, address, and private key. Print it. Keep it somewhere safe. <SEP> Once you have the password, adress, and private-key -- you are done. You have a wallet / bank account. It is yours. No one in the world should ever know your password or private key. <SEP> how to buy etherereum from it then can we buy directly ethereum from our local currency  instead of converting bitcoin <SEP> Good question. <SEP> Here is what will happen <SEP> There are four things: (1) Your US dollars / other currency (you have) (2) Your ethereum wallet (you just made) (3) A website with an exchange (A place to buy ethereum for US dollars) (4) A wallet on the exchange <SEP> You need to create an  <SEP> ok",will ethereum take over bitcoin? and when all are busy buying bitcoins?

This will protect the contract's users from accidentally sending their ether to the void. <SEP> @picojoule I have read the Etherum Blogs. I read them as soon as I saw them come out over the past few days.  I guess my question is why is there not more information about this since it is such a HUGE issue. <SEP> @NG_Fourth_twitter is there any information in particular that you're interested in? theres been almost an overwhelming amount of discussion about it on reddit and here IMO <SEP> It is a huge issue, although more so for the DAO than for ethereum itself.

And, which is your reference of case-study? * Is it going to be a new or existing outfit? * Are they going to be public or private? * Are they going to be B2B, B2C or thru middle-entity/man? ex; exhanges/brokerages would have to deal with multiple parties * Take a research on the country of origin that you're in (or your study-case) * Many countries have Central-Banks that regulates the financial sectors (ex; be it banks, financial, investments, insurances, etc) * Big-ticket item starts from the so-called financial capability/readiness (ex; to establish a bank, one may need minimum CAPEX of $2Billion - figures depend on which countries, could be slightly lower for small-ticket items) * How about cost-recovery factor? Some countries allow for cost-recovery if such institution is directly associated with the regulators/governments - thus lowering their financial exposures * Where will they have their operations (US, China, India - or other cost competitive markets; if they are not regulated domestically in country of origin)? * All the above would have different economics/cost-models; hence the figures would differ among each-other * Once you zoom-into such pointers/variables, your iterations would resulted in different economics (NPVs, IRRs, ROIs). * Your average would then need to conclude/compare the different types of financial institution `categories` when it comes to implementation of blockchain-tech (and its eco-systems) - be it BTC, ETH, XLM, NEO, etc.  :information_source: Hence, it would be too generic to conclude an `average` if the variables are inconclusive.

Now you need around $25K to hire a Solidity developer (or learn the stuff yourself in 6-12 months) to write secure contracts. You'll also need $20K-$25K for an audit.

Was that a question? <SEP> If you have not built what's needed to burn tokens, then your token holders should send their balances to your address in exchange for tokens on another chain. <SEP> yes <SEP> Sending a balance to any address for which there is NO known  private key, makes it forever unavailable for further transfers. <SEP> @phalexo that's the  idea.

Folks who can finally put a halt to the off-topic political debate about fork purity, ETH vs. ETC, advertising for one or the other, and adspam about shopping that works with digital assets?

Unfortunately, getting a new account to login to Gitter with is pretty easy so banning has limited effectiveness. <SEP> Would be nice if admins could delete messages from banned users, that would make it so the banned people had less of a negative impact on the overall chat stream, could be a good suggestion for Gitter.im. <SEP> where is the ETC ether DAO ????? <SEP> Lol.

Also, it is correct that use of ether for contracts on Ethereum is far more important to the ecosystem than is token volume on exchanges. <SEP> @A2be Lets not revitalize that conversation here in the Welcome channel.",is there a designated moderator in the shopawl channel?

Summarization," <SEP> Hi Looking for a developer who can create an asset based cryptocurrency on Ethereum <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Mind explaining? <SEP> Well forgive the ignorance: A client is looking to set up a cryptocurrency which is backed by physical tradeable assets such as Platinum and Ethanol... <SEP> eg 1 Token will be equal to 1 gram of platinum metal. <SEP> How does ETH work? <SEP> I'm new to the whole digital currency scene. I currently don't own any BTC or ETH. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Tks!! <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You would have to set the price manually or offer an exchange <SEP> You can't do it solely on the chain <SEP> @thatonetrick_twitter It's a cryptocurrency. Your wallet is a set of data used to sign transactions (say that it was you). <SEP> Your balance is a number on a dataset contained by thousands os different computers that verify each other. <SEP> The the price would be set against the price of the physical asset trading on the global markets. eg. If the price of  platinum is $35per gram then the token will be trading at $35 and have its price change according to the platimum held. There will be physical platimum held in storage. <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter So what needs to be done is a generic ERC20 <SEP> Then you need a central exchange to fix the price <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You'd have to rely on an outside service to feed platinum prices into the contract all the time. Will you be making a market to keep the prices linked? <SEP> @phalexo The coin doesn't need the price. The exchange does. <SEP> And the number doesn't matter if it has no backing. <SEP> So they need an exchange and a standard ERC20 with whatever constructor they choose. (I mean, doesn't have to be ERC20 but...) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Maybe  I am wrong but I think he wants to accept fiat currencies in exchange for platinum. These coins would essentially be depository receipts. <SEP> The coin itself can be linked to a gram of platinum of particular purity, this does not need to change, but allowing people to buy with USD, EURO is more involved. <SEP> Thanks yes. More or less. There is going to be reliance on an official price feed which will then automatcally translate in value to the coin <SEP> Yeah but that's exchange level <SEP> How do you mean? Because we are saying buy 1 token equal to 1 gram which is stored in Vault X. The token moves according to the price of the platinum traded on the global markets <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Are you fixing the coin price to platinum or something else? <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter To enforce that, you need to have an exchange that sets the price and buy/sells for that amount. <SEP> Else, the market will decide the value. <SEP> Even if the coin stores a number labelled value, that doesn't make it worth that. <SEP> To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams or have a exchange for the fiat (or crypto) equivalent per coin <SEP> If a coin could say and enforce a value, I would make one for 100 USD rn and sell them all <SEP> You can have the exchange in the coin but then you're stuck with a ETH/ERC20 value map <SEP> Ok so if I am hearing you right. We need to create an exchange for the cryptocurrency Buy/Sell <SEP> Is that right? <SEP> Yes <SEP> You need to buy and sell the coin for that value <SEP> If you only sell it, then you can't use it. It's worthless <SEP> Only buy? It doesnt get distribution <SEP> Let's say they take a deposit of 1 gram of Pt from a citizen, and issue 1 token to signify that any time this citizen wants a gram of Pt back all he has to do is send in his 1 coin. There is no need for making the market. The coin is pegged to the value of platinum. <SEP> You only need to make a market if you want rates to float. <SEP> And that counts as an exchange <SEP> ""To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams"" <SEP> No idea how the group makes money though <SEP> They're the only exchange in this idea. They can't sell to themselves <SEP> Some fees for storage. <SEP> I guess. Why not just keep the Platinum then? <SEP> Providing security. <SEP> Ok can it be done? If so how long would it take to launch? <SEP> Commodity exchanges are regulated,, you need to consult with attorneys if you can legally do this and if you need to register your exchange. <SEP> And then there's the issue if something does happen to the platinum <SEP> Everyone would sue you for the money <SEP> You need to talk to people about accepting Fiat if you do that <SEP> If you just take Eth, you can get the exchange software up in a few days <SEP> You said this was a client of yours?

Summarization," <SEP> @kayabaNerve Let's say, an application with blockchain has 1000 users, it's may happen that 10 of the 1000 users launch TXs at the same time, which means that logically the smart contract will be interacted at the same time. If the smart contract is singleton and how does this TXs are done on blockchain? <SEP> @mingbai so. TXs aren't handled instantly <SEP> They have to be verified by mining <SEP> Once a group of transactions is mined, all work by others to mine that block is thrown out <SEP> So it isn't all at once <SEP> And then miners do order transactions sequentially <SEP> That said, I forget how and if it just checks for errors (no double send), or if you can get and send in the same block <SEP> @DewaldDeJager Right, it was just an example. What about being dropped politicallysensitivetabootokens though. <SEP> I'm not to worried personally, but could envision problems in general. <SEP> I did not realize that Netheralnds is a police state. <SEP> Those would go into the trash instead of being plastered on a public ledger via an account I might choose to be associated with. <SEP> @phalexo all states besides anarchist states are <SEP> Duh <SEP> @phalexo It's not too bad, I wish we had more and better equipped police myself. <SEP> :) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Let me clarify it easy. Mining on a block only accessible by one miner at once and so the TXs are sequentially mined into the block, which means that the mark of completion of a transaction is whether it's mined or not.  Even a group of TXs are coming at the same time, the mining process will deal with them sequentially to the block. <SEP> @kayabaNerve So at the bottom of mine() process is a single thread process....

Something which you can do to avoid this (but which won't help you now), is that Mist only uses the bundled Geth copy if there isn't already a node running.     So if you run geth FIRST, and then run Mist, it will connect to that running node, rather than launching its own. <SEP> But yeah - that doesn't help you right now.

There is a reddit community for ETH-C and since they are the underdogs at the moment in this race I suspect you would find them to be a more helpful audience for information on how to trade both ETH-F and ETH-C on your exchange. <SEP> there is no public channel for trading and exchange info? <SEP> as far as I'm aware there is/was some coordination with exchanges <SEP> You do have to be careful trading either at the moment.  If you don't account for the two chains you can easily screw yourself or your users, even if you only trade one of the chains.

That would be strange <SEP> I don't run things, but I don't believe there is any chat channel for this at the moment (I agree, there should be). <SEP> @Zoltu the thing is that exchanges are kind of forced to coordinate or risk some issues. seems some exchanges haven't followed EF advice and listed ETC anyway <SEP> At the core, your exchange just needs to make sure it has separate accounts for each of the chains.  You can do an additional service to your users by auto-replaying any transactions on both chains and issuing users a refund on the chain they didn't mean to trade on.  I don't know if any exchanges do this now but it could set yours apart as being more ""user-friendly"". <SEP> @benjyz Yep, I recognize the problem here.

Summarization," <SEP> Hey everyone.. How much work would it really take for a company like Alibaba to pivot to BlockChain technology? <SEP> I am working on a BlockChain based platform which would create an open marketplace for businesses but concerned about competition from Amazon and Alibaba. With their platforms being central server based I can't imagine that they can pivot to BlockChain easily but I am not a developer hence my question <SEP> hello ,  what is the type of algorithm used by the ethereum ? thanks <SEP> @rtm226_twitter: My experience with established companies and the blockchain is that they usually don't embrace it, ( else banks would be flocking to it). The reason could be that at the top there is usually a CEO and board whose main job is to  keep the business going in a smooth way, so they might perceive it as a risk. I am not sure about your project, but I believe that if it something you feel passionate about you  should do it. <SEP> @KenoLeon thank you for the quick reply. Definately something I am passionate about and we are working on but since the concept is similiar to that of Alibaba and Amazon wanted to see from a coding/developer perspective how difficult or easy it would be to pivot <SEP> I did not think it would be easy and since we are a startup could give us a huge first mover competitive advantage being a BlockChain based company.. The future is moving to BlockChain just a matter of time <SEP> also @KenoLeon  if interested I can send you some more info on the project <SEP> Hey Buddy! Check this out to get started on the spec. address An Ethereum address represents an account. For EOA, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account, e.g., cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826. This is a hexadecimal format (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by appending 0x to the address.

Summarization," <SEP> Hello <SEP> at 2016 i started to mine ethereum in my office and everything was on my coinomy wallet <SEP> At 2017 i was driving and the window was open <SEP> My phone suddenly fell out of my car and broke hard <SEP> In those days I wasn't very accurate person and I relied on my phone <SEP> And after the accident I lost everything and couldn't access my wallet because I didn't have anything from my wallet <SEP> I have tried a lot of ways to fix my Samsung phone but no one can help me and everybody says to say goodbye to your phone because it damaged very bad <SEP> What should I do? <SEP> Because i dont have my recovery phrase and i cant access my device <SEP> I sent this message to coinomi : <SEP> I decided some days ago to try for my Etherium too It is not fair  I had trust in you when everybody said do not trust cryptocurrency and wallets I had trusted to etherium when everybody was selling it I tried to mine It I tried to mine it and hold it in your wallet   I had around 3 bitcoin in my Binance account One day I sent 700$ bitcoin to a wrong Id address  I tried to connect them and day propose me a little money for using their bot to search their blocks and servers and finally, after 1 weak they found it and took it back to me it is no privacy when I can't access my money; what is the difference between it or stealing my money by theft because of week privacy  When I say I didnt join my wallet in late of 2017 or early 2018 It is the right clue and it showed im saying right because I'm the owner of it and I didn't join it from that time because I couldn't  The next clue is that most of my wallet is filled with etherium or perhaps off it  It is not private if you cant access to wallets  Because first of all, I had trust in you then I sent all my miner profit to your wallet  I'm young and I invested most of my money in mining it is not fair if I can't access to it   Secondly, I sent my broken phone to you, you can check if your wallet save device models when I was going to your wallet by it  You know, I had my recovery phrase But unfortunately I kept codes to my phone and when that accident happened  i lost everything <SEP> And they just answered me : <SEP> Coinomi has zero access to your coins / funds <SEP> You cannot restore without the phrase <SEP> Always - I repeat: always - make sure you secure any seed phrase for a wallet on either a second device/machine or even better on paper that it stored in a secure location, separate from your device(s) so it can even be recovered in case your apartment etc. burns down. <SEP> With a seed phrase or other ""wallet backup"" your wallet contents are irretrievably lost when you lose or break the device containing the phrase <SEP> @ghost~604414de6da037398465c4bd: in your case, one thing that could in theory still work is to retrieve the data off the storage chip of the phone, for which you usually need to hire an expert <SEP> depending on how much value is on that wallet, you can decide if that is economically worth it <SEP> These fake stories look like ""I had a $100 in my back pocket, really I did. And a strong gust of wind just blew my $100 out of my pocket, and into the sewer. Since it was raining, my $100 must have been flushed all the way down to the ocean. It is so very unfair that I don't have my $100 anymore."" <SEP> Hello, a fundamental barrier to scientific progress in academia is having to seek funding through centralized grant agencies. Additionally it is slowed by centralized publishing. In short, I am using create-eth-app + truffle + react-app + ganache to develop an searchable environment (app name: dFund) for scientist to propose individual experiments (ie ethereum wallets)  with the experimental details, cost, and agreement to load data _back into the blockchain_, outlined in smart contracts. Then the people, in the same environment, can choose to fund ethereum wallets containing smart contract experiment experiments worth conducting.  The problem is I am a biochemist (I work at hopkins in baltimore, USA) and I do not know squat about coding and am learning on the fly and would love some advice on how to deploy a dApp after it is developed. My email is mmhurley513@gmail.com, if this interests you and you know whats up with web3 please reach out! <SEP> I think a big part that I am not emphasizing is the burden on the scientist to load the data from the 'ethereum funded' experiment back into the block chain. This way the results would be saved and distributed, no reason to involve centralized publication services as well. <SEP> Distributed to whom? The key part is to publicize the findings so that those who would be interested pay attention. Just because you load something into the chain  does not mean anyone will look or care. <SEP> @phalexo: By loading data back into the smart contract that funded the experiment, to my limited understanding, would distribute the data amongst those involved with the contract. That is what I mean by distributed. Perhaps part of every smart contract would be to load a manuscript to the open source archive  (maybe you could make the website accessable by QR code) <SEP> www.biorxiv.org is an example. This way the data could be more widely accessible, but its authenticity and immediate distribution can be done with the smart contract in the dApp. <SEP> A smart contract does not actively ""distribute"" anything. You would need a program that runs outside the chain to query for data, it is all transaction based. Your contributors would have to query the chain. It is not clear why you need the blockchain. <SEP> Companies like Patreon,   and others cater to content producers, and your supporters can donate to your research if you can convince them to do so. <SEP> anyone wanna sell me ropsten ETH? <SEP> $1/ETH i'll buy 100",i lost everything when my phone fell out of my car and broke hard

However, I'll share why... :smiley_cat:   Fyi, we continuously undertake technical-evaluation of the eco-systems (ex : BTC, Ethereum, Quorum, etc) to establish acceptable-use of a Smart Contract. One  concept/prototype is on a Taxation Systems (Government) where a Smart-Contract is establish between the TaxAuthority and TaxPayer; thus enabling both to commit transaction based on a Smart-Contract parameters that would trigger collections & refunds.  Reason for sharing the above is - our prototype seems to have few similarities with your inquiry. Some briefs: - `Cross-chain model` Smart Contract between the Party A (TaxAuthority) and party B (TaxPayer), - Pre-Defined Smart-Contract/Wallet between Party A and Party B, - Wallet for ID's, funds (for collection/refund triggered by mutually/consensus-agreed tax parameters), -  Protocols of one-time-only event between Party A and Party B, - Will not recognize transaction by Party A or Party B not complying the parameters (thus giving controls to both the TaxAuthority and TaxPayer to ignore triggers for collection or refund), - A gas-share is defined by incentives given by the TaxAuthority to the TaxPayer thru a conditional-triggers (as attraction b'coz TaxPayer would want to pay anything extra right? :smile: ) - Any stray-transaction will go to the TaxAuthority coffers :worried:   As these are prototypes, I'm still 'not that' ready to commercialize the work to avoid escalation of issues. From our R&D stage, we are more driven with a mature PoS stage  i.e. security, centralization risk, energy efficiency (due to numerous issues with PoW and as some eco-systems is yet 'maturely/fully-PoS'.)  p/s : Also fyi, we work extensively as technology-enabler environment (and less on ICOs, currencies-related). :smile: If need be, do PM for updates. <SEP> NOVA ICO COM BONUS DE 25 MOEDAS NA INSCRUCAO. <SEP>  https://www.affiliatecoin.io?ref=aff24c00-8797-42bd-9022-1c1e11b57e1c",How can I Buy it from India?

I had my hard drive wiped and lost my account info on mist.  is there anyway I can import my account again without the key? or is there a way to find my key? <SEP> Hi all, I work for a company developing an ICO. I'm the chief developer so I'm looking at learning Solidity myself. In the mean time we got a quote for $40,000 and 4% of the ICO proceeds just for writing the contract. This seems steep, to put it politely. This may be a gold rush thing where people throw money at it, I don't know. Thoughts? <SEP> @johnmott59 My thought is you being in the USA need to think about avoiding federal penitentiary . The SEC just filed charges against a real estate related company and closed down their ICO. You'd need to consult a securities attorney whether or not your token/coin would be a security. p.s. How complicated is your contract? Is  it just a regular token to represent shares? <SEP> thank you, our ICO is a utility token and we have securities attorneys to help us out . we have a clear utility token use case, the token represents a value from earned activity without an expectation of value increase. <SEP> I think the contract should be a straightforward crowd sale but there is a distance between 'think' and 'reality' ;-) <SEP> I don't want to over think it but at the same time don't want to step onto a land mine because something wasn't properly coded. <SEP> @johnmott59 Sounds like you'd need some kind of mining functionality. The fact of life is you will make mistakes, i.e. need some means to upgrade your contract, i.e. use of router contracts, some other forms of upgradeable contracts. <SEP> I downloaded the Ethereum Wallet and sent 42 ETH to wallet.  Then I sent 5 ETH to Cobinhood.com to invest in ICO.  Cobinhood never accepted the transfer because I ""did not have sufficient gas"".  However the 5 ETH were never returned to my wallet.  And I have not been able to get a response from Ethereum Wallet support for 5 days. Who can help me? <SEP> There is no ""Ethereum Wallet"" support. It is not a company. <SEP> The earned value will occur outside of ethereum, the tokens are a form of payment so i don't think we need to mine. I agree about mistakes, etc, which is why we wanted to get some one that had done it once or twice. I think this is a no-brainer $200-300hr software work but can't see $40,000 and certainly can't see a percentage outside of a bonus perhaps. Am I off the mark here on the amount of software work required? <SEP> @johnmott59 Well, I know that the going price to audit someone else's contract for security and efficiency, etc... is about $30K.  One can slap together something  from all the code floating around, if you know what to slap together.  It might take a good engineer about 2 months to get the ropes. If you are a total genius,  maybe 6 weeks. How much do you get paid to be the chief developer per month? Do the math. Whoever might be willing to work for you can just as easily spend his time on his own project. I am developing two things , for example. <SEP> fair enough. You do pay a premium for someone else's learning time, and I respect that. Just didn't have a sense of the scope of numbers. <SEP> @johnmott59 I agree, however, that 4% of an ICO is outrageous. :-) <SEP> @johnmott59  it doesnt take 2 months ...neither 6 weeks, where do u get those numbers <SEP> I didn't propose the time frames for development. <SEP> i wrote mine in 15 minutes... @johnmott59 <SEP> @ingamx Certainly not from you.

So you have access to the same level of complexity, but only for a limited amount of time. <SEP> Hey @pinecrest515, You would need to troubleshoot this with your friend using block-chain explorers, etc. If no exchange was involved, the most likely thing is that some mistake was made in the target address.

I really can see ethereum - being distributed - as a game changer for a lot of things so i have a lot of reading to do and for the first time in years i'm actually excited by tech again.

It can be either really bad for new ICOs outside of China, or maybe good because the ICOs outside of China will have less competition from ICOs on the mainland. <SEP> I think I'll likely make my first investment into Eth when the price stops dropping, when it's as low as it's likely to get. <SEP> Does this law now affect lets say for example a switzerland ICO that allowed Chinese citizens to invesT? <SEP> I doubt it will affect the switz ICO aside from the initial panic, and loss of chinese clientelle. China is unlikely to be able to enforce anything outside of China. <SEP> So it's highly unlikely that the Swiss ICO will have to pay back to Chinese citizens. <SEP> fair <SEP> @Zero-Bits The Chinese government can block all the outside internet access to sites that run ICOs. It is not about the past but the future. <SEP> Crypto likely has a future in China. However, for the near future at least, the Chinese market is likely as dead as it can get. <SEP> Does anyone know if the mainland Chinese government  have control over Hong Kong internet access? <SEP> They blocked Facebook, but you sure have a bunch of Chinese that use VPN servers and access facebook. The same will happen with ICO's.   American's are blocked but we still get on ICO's through VPN's. Just like the Cayman islands are the ""companies"" address... the same will happen.

Gtter is really just chat associated with Github repositories, often the github repositories for the actual code.    Your best community is the ethermining sub-reddit, I think. On the newbie-ness, yeah, we're all newbies! RE: That download link.   Aha - right.  So yeah, that is the 0.9.41 ""official"" binary.   And that's the installer, right? At https://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/.  So it isn't a fork - it's official, but it's really old too.    You can see at https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases how many releases there have been since.     Having said that, if it is working for you, I would recommend that you DO NOT change.    Using a really old Ethereum node (eth) won't even work any more, because of the Homestead hardfork, but isn't a problem for the mining code, where the requirements haven't changed.  We're still trying to work out how best to move forward with the official miner.  See https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/313 and https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/315.  Which guide pointed you at the old 0.9.41 binary?    I'm also still learning about the guides.   Given that the guides WORK, following them is the right thing to do.     It would be great if we could fix the forking and get everybody using the latest-and-greatest, and get the official miner to get the go-to-choice, but that will be a process.      Anything you can do to help educate me on what works and what doesn't, and what miners are actually doing would be very helpful.

This ends up being very expensive. <SEP> Ethereum errs on the side of not trusting people.  This also ends up being very expensive.  :P <SEP> what I meant is .. there could have been a password recovery tool. <SEP> There can't be without sacrificing security for everyone. <SEP> If there is a password recovery tool, then it means passwords are available to someone other than the person who created the password. <SEP> In such a scenario, the user implicitly has to trust someone else with that information.  If you trust someone then give them your password.  :D <SEP> the opposite is also true.. not even the person who created can access it .. <SEP> That is no what I mean.. I secondary or a reminder phrase.. something of the sort <SEP> would be handy <SEP> The security of the account is only as secure as the weakest link. <SEP> So if there was a recovery process that involved answering some questions, then your password might as well just be the answer to those questions. <SEP> And generally, security questions are *super* breakable, especially when you can brute force them. <SEP> there was only one time password input.. then only months after sync-ing that it was ready to be used again .. <SEP> Last I looked, there was a note and that was it. <SEP> ok thanks . for the chat ! <SEP> It should really be banged into the users head, ""IF YOU LOSE THIS KEY OR FORGET YOUR PASSWORD YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR MONEY AND NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IT BACK!"" <SEP> Unfortunately instead it is more like, ""you might want to back this up when convenient..."" <SEP> @Hamarana_twitter Did you have a significant amount of ETH in the account? <SEP> If not you can always just create a new account.

I had my hard drive wiped and lost my account info on mist.  is there anyway I can import my account again without the key? or is there a way to find my key? <SEP> Hi all, I work for a company developing an ICO. I'm the chief developer so I'm looking at learning Solidity myself. In the mean time we got a quote for $40,000 and 4% of the ICO proceeds just for writing the contract. This seems steep, to put it politely. This may be a gold rush thing where people throw money at it, I don't know. Thoughts? <SEP> @johnmott59 My thought is you being in the USA need to think about avoiding federal penitentiary . The SEC just filed charges against a real estate related company and closed down their ICO. You'd need to consult a securities attorney whether or not your token/coin would be a security. p.s. How complicated is your contract? Is  it just a regular token to represent shares? <SEP> thank you, our ICO is a utility token and we have securities attorneys to help us out . we have a clear utility token use case, the token represents a value from earned activity without an expectation of value increase. <SEP> I think the contract should be a straightforward crowd sale but there is a distance between 'think' and 'reality' ;-) <SEP> I don't want to over think it but at the same time don't want to step onto a land mine because something wasn't properly coded. <SEP> @johnmott59 Sounds like you'd need some kind of mining functionality. The fact of life is you will make mistakes, i.e. need some means to upgrade your contract, i.e. use of router contracts, some other forms of upgradeable contracts. <SEP> I downloaded the Ethereum Wallet and sent 42 ETH to wallet.  Then I sent 5 ETH to Cobinhood.com to invest in ICO.  Cobinhood never accepted the transfer because I ""did not have sufficient gas"".  However the 5 ETH were never returned to my wallet.  And I have not been able to get a response from Ethereum Wallet support for 5 days. Who can help me? <SEP> There is no ""Ethereum Wallet"" support. It is not a company. <SEP> The earned value will occur outside of ethereum, the tokens are a form of payment so i don't think we need to mine. I agree about mistakes, etc, which is why we wanted to get some one that had done it once or twice. I think this is a no-brainer $200-300hr software work but can't see $40,000 and certainly can't see a percentage outside of a bonus perhaps. Am I off the mark here on the amount of software work required? <SEP> @johnmott59 Well, I know that the going price to audit someone else's contract for security and efficiency, etc... is about $30K.  One can slap together something  from all the code floating around, if you know what to slap together.  It might take a good engineer about 2 months to get the ropes. If you are a total genius,  maybe 6 weeks. How much do you get paid to be the chief developer per month? Do the math. Whoever might be willing to work for you can just as easily spend his time on his own project. I am developing two things , for example. <SEP> fair enough. You do pay a premium for someone else's learning time, and I respect that. Just didn't have a sense of the scope of numbers. <SEP> @johnmott59 I agree, however, that 4% of an ICO is outrageous. :-) <SEP> @johnmott59  it doesnt take 2 months ...neither 6 weeks, where do u get those numbers <SEP> I didn't propose the time frames for development. <SEP> i wrote mine in 15 minutes... @johnmott59 <SEP> @ingamx Certainly not from you.

I lost my private key. Please what can I do. <SEP> How can I revover it. Please I seriously need a help. <SEP> @ronaldpetty :Ethereum has a virtual machine baked into the blockchain, think a general purpose computer with a lot of specific blockchain functions. One  of the things you can do is mint new cryptocurrencies or tokens in Ethereum speak, so these new coins are built on top of the Ethereum network and depend to a certain point on it. A regular ICO would be making a new blockchain and mineable currency with it's own distributed network. <SEP> @KenoLeon thanks for that.  Would the new currency still in the end be using gas/eth under the hood? (part of the EVM) <SEP> @ronaldpetty a crypto currency isn't really something you can own, it is literally a number inside a database but that database isnt counterfeit able , so a crypto currency inside ethereum or outside ethereum are the same, the difference is what you can do with it, for example, if you create a new blockchain it would be independent of ethereum and you could set all the rules by which it operates and inside ethereum you should adjust to the rules and times of ethereum plus you should pay for gas prices in ether <SEP> @ronaldpetty : If you are talking about an ICO built on Ethereum, the answer is that for now it depends, it costs ether (in the form of gas) every time you interact via a transaction, and you need at least one or a few  initial transactions to make and distribute a coin. After that it gets a little more complicated, in the sense that some things don't require ether for now ( calling a function  that doesn't change state for instance), but most likely yes, transaction (buy/sell/transfer) in tokens ride on top and incur on ether costs since they do change state, hope that's somehow clear. <SEP> Thanks @gelanderos @KenoLeon , I think in the case when people say there are laucnhing there own ICO w/Ethereum under the hood, it means they are using the blockchain on Ethereum (EVM, gas, etc), but doing something like alt coins where they tied contracts to outside things?  Can a currency be build on ethereum, where the whole thing is in ethereum as say contracts (making like a state machine on top of the EVM)? or both <SEP> @phalexo I agree with that but it's supposed to be delayed and introduced baby steps so that miners who recently got into mining get a shot to recover at least part of the investments they incurred in, and of course I don't like POS but I like POW even less, there should be a reliable consensus algorithm which won't give the rich too much power like POS and that isn't as harmful, slow and unreliable like POW <SEP> @ronaldpetty You are mostly correct on the first part, although ```contracts tied to 'things'``` could perhaps be better  phrased as: cryptocurrencies have a decentralized blockchain or transaction ledger that's mineable, supply limits and other common characteristics, alt-coins in general offer a new improvement or specialization  (ethereum a virtual machine, zcash privacy, litecoin speed  etc, etc). The second part doesn't really makes sense to me;  a currency built on ethereum is a contract, and the state machine is a characteristic of certain contracts  afforded by the EVM. <SEP> Thanks @KenoLeon will think some more on things <SEP> and for a small niche currency like your burger coins that isnt a given <SEP> ok thank you. So can I ask also in the example I gave ,  to buy my token you would need to transfer 1 eth for 20 of my ERC20 tokens via a smart contract. How could you buy my token with bitcoins ?",i lost my private key. what can i do.

So as a fundraising mechanism <SEP> So an automated verification for receivers to be vetted before receiving donations? <SEP> To create transparency and credible verification when money is sent, that can then be scaled with minimal transaction costs <SEP> yes <SEP> but also that the donor is sure that the agency doesn't skim <SEP> that once the code is in place all money is going to the verified accounts <SEP> interesting idea. but that would imply that the agency would continue to operate in ethereum all the way to the end user correct? <SEP> actually there'd be a mechanism to convert it to the local currency of the recipient <SEP> the recipient would just see dollars, euros, sheckels arriving in their account <SEP> the donors are donating in whatever currency as well <SEP> the ethereum is the middle portion that verifies the transaction occurs <SEP> as it is meant to <SEP> If I'm understanding correctly, wouldn't the idea be to verify and ensure the end receiver is worthy. and the contract creator would act as the agency? <SEP> yes <SEP> and once the accounts are deemed as worthy <SEP> the transfers occur automatically direct-deposit <SEP> interesting. So you/the owners of the contract would sell the people a token as a donation, facilitate the transfer of the donation to the end receiver, and end up in the receivers account in the form of local currency <SEP> I don't know if I'd sell a token....i'd have an interface where people are just with their credit cards or accounts transferring money to the charity <SEP> then i suppose the transaction takes the form of a token <SEP> you've got huge hurdles to automate currency conversions. for example from USD to token, token to CNY(receiver of donation) <SEP> in the middle-layer <SEP> coinbase --- shapeshift --- coinbase <SEP> does it have to go on a token? <SEP> This is where I'm not an expert <SEP> if you want ethereum to be the broker of the transaction <SEP> are you a coder? <SEP> not of ethereum <SEP> yeah i want the donor to buy ethereum <SEP> unknowingly <SEP> or a token <SEP> or ethereum <SEP> the ethereum is transferred to the qualified account but in the currencies that the accounts are in <SEP> There could be another model of transaction where the recipient is getting ethereum or bitcoin (but this would require confirmation of the recipient that they know what that is) <SEP> we need a programmer to tell us what can be done <SEP> simple enough. Sell people ""Mark"" Tokens USD, which you can create a smart contract for,  and then control the mark tokens wallet for them, and then transfer the mark tokens to receiver account for them, and then allow the receiver of the donation to withdraw in the funds of their choice <SEP> I could do all of the things you described without being a programmer.

Summarization," <SEP> Hi <SEP> is there a developer in here for ETH? <SEP> Whats up? <SEP> Depends on what your question is.

I run geth client on background with this command geth --datadir C:\Program Files\Geth init testnet_genesis.json; geth --datadir c:\Program Files\Geth --networkid 3 console . Is there a problem with the mist update or am i doing something wrong? <SEP> petrosmit :  open a command promp and and type <SEP> cd  C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum Wallet\binaries\Geth\unpacked\geth-windows-amd64-1.5.2-c8695209 <SEP> this should put you in the right folder where geth is then type <SEP> geth removedb this will delete the block chain <SEP> then type <SEP> geth --fast --cache=512 --maxpeers 75 --jitvm this should start downloading the Bock chain again from scratch and will take approx 3-5hrs depending on your connection speed <SEP> DON't open Mist or the ether wallet (depending on witch one your using ) until it completly finishes . Sometimes it may get stuck and if you stop it syncing and then restart it ,it will not download quick (fast) and slows right down. The fast command does not work if it sees that you have some of the Block chain , you have to delete the Block chain and start again <SEP> The first 750,000 blocks should download in approx 30 mins on a T2 Fibre connection and then it does slow down but that is more the fact that there is bigger blocks . Also at about 2,870,000 you may notice it 's downloading the  file structure witch is 19 million + (not shore if it's actually Blocks or just data) and will take about 2 hrs , the Block chain as of today  is 15 gig  so it does take some time and the slower your connection is the longer it will take <SEP> kin63campa NO there are no problems with ether other than there is a new update for the wallet and Mist and people may have expected that there would be trouble however this time it went smooth and there is no problems i have left some intructions for noobs to help them update without any problems as they did change a few things like not having a .exe  file that installs the update but that is probably because there was trouble with that in the last few updates . Mind you a bit more instructions at the gethub site may have helped <SEP> Jernej Cernalogar  Copy your keys from the ketstore  to a seperate folder somewhere or a flash rom stick and that will make shore you won't lose your money  you will find the ketstore in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum\keystore  for windows. Once you have the latsest Mist or wallet sorted you can copy your keys back to the ketstore and the wallet should just pick them up and your balance should be correct . Also read my earler posts on how to update , i have already updated and copied the new file to the Mist folder and had NO problems syncing in fact it's faster than the older version so well done guys <SEP> John Threat follow my instructions  that i have posted for Jernej Cernloger <SEP> John Threat you can tell witch ether you have  from where you may be mining from  if it's from ethermine.org then your mining Etherhash  if it's from etc.ethermine.org then it's Ether Classic . Also if you used geth  1.4.11 and did not use  --support-dao-fork in the command line  then your Block Chain is Ether Classic and not Etherhash . You need to use  --support-dao-fork . If you have the latest  geth 1.5.3 it should automatically be following the dao fork  and would mean your Block Chain is Etherhash <SEP> odutola kamoruden When you load Mist or the Ether wallet it will ask you once it's running and syncing to open a account . You will be able to by ether at this point  just follow the on screen instuctions , However you do not need to buy ether to open a account , you just wont be able to make a contract until you have at least 1 ether in it <SEP> ops John Threat sorry follow instructions i gave for  petrosmit my bad sorry <SEP> @beaver25  Thank you so much for your input.  I do as you say , i deleted the db and run the command but after 5 mins it stops. this is the last thing that shows: goroutine 21658  <SEP> petrosmit  : what version of Mist or wallet are you using ?  If you have geth version 1.4.11 you will need to use this command line after you delete the block chain and start again : geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 75 --jitvm  i have had trouble when i have not used the --support-dao-fork command so try again .  I think you can't get around not downloading the whole chain before you deploy a contract  . You could try uninstalling everything and restarting the system and then reinstall Just mist but install 0.8.7 and that way i know you will have all the right programs in the right places  . However i would remove what is in the Mist folder in c:\user\yourusertname\AppData\Local\Mist and copy the new version 0.8.8 to the Mist folder you have just deleted don't remove the folder Mist just what is inside it . You can download the new version and just unzip it to any folder you wish , it's the contents of the folder you copy and paste to your Mist folder in C:\users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Mist . Don't run Mist until you have  replaced the Mist contents with the new versionif you do it this way don't run geth  just run Mist and let it download . If you still having trouble i would check your connection to see if it's dropping out and contact your ISP .remember if you stop it from downloading you will have to start from scratch as the second time you start it it will not download fast if you have not deleted the chain <SEP> Jim i would not worry about using the program you said . Just use switch fast and convert the Classic ether to something else like light coin or Bitcoin and wait till the price improves a bit and then use Switch fast to convert the light coin or Bitcoin back to ether  just be mind full of the prices when you convert it if you do it right you may even end up with a few more ether and not lose anything <SEP> Jim : however that would mean you will need another type of wallet i would go with Bitcoin and don't download the whole node type of wallet just download one of the  app based types that don't need you to download the whole Block chain or open a online wallet to get a bitcoin address to do the convertion i have used this site to do such a thing :   https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/ <SEP> I guys ! i'm on the blockchain concept but i don't find an really good tutorial  about it. the goods ones seem to be not free (no at all ).

People are saying miners don't care about the gas fees. <SEP> gas price of 0 is possible? or is it now a gas price as percentage of transaction sum <SEP> It is possible. <SEP> but for creating a smart contract you need ether still? <SEP> ... nope. You need gas. You pay what you want for gas. <SEP> It was never 'needed'. <SEP> But you won't get your TX mined <SEP> It's a half truth. Ether is still needed. Even if miner's didn't care about the gas fees, everyone would have to switch for 0 gas fee TXs to be processed. <SEP> That said, miners do care. Gas fees surpass the block reward, last I checked. Increasing the block reward increases inflation. <SEP> so there is now the option to do transaction for 0 ether? <SEP> in theory but not practically <SEP> There always was, however, your TX won't be mined for a long time. <SEP> Gas prices incentive miners to mine your TX. With no incentive.. <SEP> and thats it but ether is still the gas of ethereum plattform? <SEP> Ether was never gas. It's a utility token to pay for gas. <SEP> jes and then people in social media showed up and said ether is going to drop <SEP> where did Vitalik say this?",i want to know about the new changes on the plattform how are transactions now feed

But to understand `Smart Contract` itself would be beneficial in order to appreciate its eco-systems, especially the part of coding the smart contract itself.  Useful read @ https://codeburst.io/build-your-first-ethereum-smart-contract-with-solidity-tutorial-94171d6b1c4b <SEP> @AliceTheHive The fastest way is to get someone who knows what he is doing. Hm. Finding those people might be a long process though. <SEP> @phalexo Emmm... Wonder any of those `someone` would come  forward an advertise him/herself here... :smile:  Then he/she would make good :moneybag: <SEP> @legeend6_twitter  <SEP> @AliceTheHive Although in general it might not be a bad idea, but here 99.999% of potential ""customers"" are total flakes. They think they can get things  done for them for a few pennies, with none of it paid up front. I am about to sign a contract with a company that does professional Solidity development, and they ask their customers for 50% up front to make sure the customer is not a flake. <SEP> Another company with which I spoke charge $25K for normal audits (like a crowdsale contract audit) plus $5K for rush orders. Try to tell this to people here. :-) <SEP> @phalexo WOW... LOL...  :laughing: <SEP> @AliceTheHive What you see here is mostly ""I want to be fabulously rich by doing an ICO. I don't know crap about anything, please, someone do everything for me, for free or close to it."" <SEP> @phalexo  I took note of Vitalik's vision of having blockchains/smart contracts implemented on many other things (not just ICOs crowdfunding). And, we are just among those who embrace Vitalik's vision. So, I guess out of that 99.999%, we are part of that 0.111%. LOL... :laughing: <SEP> @AliceTheHive Sure, but your math is off a bit. :-) <SEP> @phalexo It's ok, the `off` part is fully-funded.! Our economic-models remains positive. :P <SEP> @AliceTheHive Do you know if Ethers granted to miners are minted or taken from some foundation reserve account? <SEP> @phalexo Emmm... Never occurs to me to think that - probably, a combination of both ... or lost ETH in-the-wild? <SEP> No one has control over ""lost ether"" so that cannot be the source. <SEP> Minted Ethers are still logical... that would keep the `blocks` in the chains in-sync... <SEP> If Ether is minted then it is a source of inflation and is keeping Ether value down. <SEP> Taking about syncing... this article is for newbies/users who are having `sync difficulties`. Well... just an info sharing  - sharing is caring :love_letter:  :kiss: :kissing_heart:  Read and try at your own perils... https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/02/14/geth-1-8-iceberg%C2%B9/ <SEP> @phalexo At some point, that would be good for real application of Vitalik's vision of blockchains.  Demand versus supply - there'll be perspectives of +/- if that happens. The `high-value` which happens now is a hype that gets to people for certain purposes/intent/opportunities. <SEP> I don't know what his vision is, but I have been thinking about applications to cyber security, tracking drug components, and such... <SEP> Hype has its utility. How do you convince a lot of sheep that something is good and they should try it? Hype. <SEP> Guys, I was wondering if some ICOs accept payments through credit card directly? And if not, why so? <SEP> @phalexo  Vitalik's did tweeted `in sarcasm` of how blockchains are used `more` towards ICOs, crowdfunding, etc... Your thoughts about other applications of blockchains seems to be supportive of  his visions. And, you are not alone. I guess you and I are that `part ' of 0.111%. LOL... :laughing: <SEP> I'm counting sheeps when I have difficuilties to sleep ... :laughing: <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter Most banks do not want that business. Fraud prone. <SEP> @AliceTheHive Learn to blank your mind. I must admit it is not easy sometimes. My trick is to mentally hum every time I sense a forming thought. <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter there are ICOs accepting credit-cards. But, be aware, do at your own perils... :crying_cat_face: <SEP> @phalexo My mind keeps working when I sleep (or in hybernation-mode). That's the perils being a technology-enabler... :cry: <SEP> @phalexo @AliceTheHive But the banks won't know tho? I mean if I allow my investors to transfer USD into my bank account and I tranfer MyToken into their ether wallet, how will the bank know? <SEP> @AliceTheHive Do you happen to know any? <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter That depends on to what extend those banks `will` undertake their corporate governance processes and policies involves. If their policies is driven by their country central banks policies, those banks may scrutinize transactions. <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter I `dare not` to state (or even recommends) any. <SEP> Aha I understand <SEP> Thanks! <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter There are KYC policies tho - as part of governance; by banks, central banks... to ensure some controls on fintech... <SEP> @AliceTheHive Yes true, if they find out sh*t would get serious lol. So what ICOs usually do is transfer the investments they got(ETH or BTC or any alt coin) into USD through exchange websites or am I mistaken? <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter They are many popular methods/principles - either `technically right vs morally wrong`, `technically wrong vs morally right`, `technically right vs morally right`, `technically wrong vs morally wrong`, etc. LOL... :smile: <SEP> The iterations are endless... :laughing: <SEP> Lolll, such an adventurous field to work in <SEP> True, and the adventures can be interesting...but one shall learn a lot... :smile: <SEP> how can we help you if we don't know all details",how to create a public blockchain?

Summarization," <SEP> Hi Looking for a developer who can create an asset based cryptocurrency on Ethereum <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Mind explaining? <SEP> Well forgive the ignorance: A client is looking to set up a cryptocurrency which is backed by physical tradeable assets such as Platinum and Ethanol... <SEP> eg 1 Token will be equal to 1 gram of platinum metal. <SEP> How does ETH work? <SEP> I'm new to the whole digital currency scene. I currently don't own any BTC or ETH. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Tks!! <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You would have to set the price manually or offer an exchange <SEP> You can't do it solely on the chain <SEP> @thatonetrick_twitter It's a cryptocurrency. Your wallet is a set of data used to sign transactions (say that it was you). <SEP> Your balance is a number on a dataset contained by thousands os different computers that verify each other. <SEP> The the price would be set against the price of the physical asset trading on the global markets. eg. If the price of  platinum is $35per gram then the token will be trading at $35 and have its price change according to the platimum held. There will be physical platimum held in storage. <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter So what needs to be done is a generic ERC20 <SEP> Then you need a central exchange to fix the price <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You'd have to rely on an outside service to feed platinum prices into the contract all the time. Will you be making a market to keep the prices linked? <SEP> @phalexo The coin doesn't need the price. The exchange does. <SEP> And the number doesn't matter if it has no backing. <SEP> So they need an exchange and a standard ERC20 with whatever constructor they choose. (I mean, doesn't have to be ERC20 but...) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Maybe  I am wrong but I think he wants to accept fiat currencies in exchange for platinum. These coins would essentially be depository receipts. <SEP> The coin itself can be linked to a gram of platinum of particular purity, this does not need to change, but allowing people to buy with USD, EURO is more involved. <SEP> Thanks yes. More or less. There is going to be reliance on an official price feed which will then automatcally translate in value to the coin <SEP> Yeah but that's exchange level <SEP> How do you mean? Because we are saying buy 1 token equal to 1 gram which is stored in Vault X. The token moves according to the price of the platinum traded on the global markets <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Are you fixing the coin price to platinum or something else? <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter To enforce that, you need to have an exchange that sets the price and buy/sells for that amount. <SEP> Else, the market will decide the value. <SEP> Even if the coin stores a number labelled value, that doesn't make it worth that. <SEP> To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams or have a exchange for the fiat (or crypto) equivalent per coin <SEP> If a coin could say and enforce a value, I would make one for 100 USD rn and sell them all <SEP> You can have the exchange in the coin but then you're stuck with a ETH/ERC20 value map <SEP> Ok so if I am hearing you right. We need to create an exchange for the cryptocurrency Buy/Sell <SEP> Is that right? <SEP> Yes <SEP> You need to buy and sell the coin for that value <SEP> If you only sell it, then you can't use it. It's worthless <SEP> Only buy? It doesnt get distribution <SEP> Let's say they take a deposit of 1 gram of Pt from a citizen, and issue 1 token to signify that any time this citizen wants a gram of Pt back all he has to do is send in his 1 coin. There is no need for making the market. The coin is pegged to the value of platinum. <SEP> You only need to make a market if you want rates to float. <SEP> And that counts as an exchange <SEP> ""To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams"" <SEP> No idea how the group makes money though <SEP> They're the only exchange in this idea. They can't sell to themselves <SEP> Some fees for storage. <SEP> I guess. Why not just keep the Platinum then? <SEP> Providing security. <SEP> Ok can it be done? If so how long would it take to launch? <SEP> Commodity exchanges are regulated,, you need to consult with attorneys if you can legally do this and if you need to register your exchange. <SEP> And then there's the issue if something does happen to the platinum <SEP> Everyone would sue you for the money <SEP> You need to talk to people about accepting Fiat if you do that <SEP> If you just take Eth, you can get the exchange software up in a few days <SEP> You said this was a client of yours?

The transaction hasn't appeared on the chain, though the amount of ether hasn't been subtracted from my balance either and in my wallet I see that the transaction itself is now no longer pending, though it was for a couple of hours. Has this transaction been rejected? Did I use too little gas? Is that amount of ether still 'reserved' and waiting for processing or has that transaction been cancelled?

Summarization," <SEP> hey guys, I had some noob questions regarding smart-contracts <SEP> how do smart-contracts actually run? <SEP> what do you mean? <SEP> they are run by miners on the network that process the transactions and the programs that are called in that block <SEP> as in, how does somebody call a smart-contract? <SEP> you can call a smart contract using one of the many ethereum clients, the easiest being the ethereum wallet <SEP> which is a GUI ether wallet with the ethereum client built in <SEP> it also has a GUI interface for sending ether, and triggering contracts <SEP> so when I call a contract, the call is broadcasted and when it reaches a miner, the miner then runs the smart-contract? <SEP> yep basically <SEP> also, how does a smart-contract store something on the blockchain? <SEP> as in, does it broadcast a request and when the next block is made by a miner, the data gets included in the block? <SEP> hmm, the actually blockchain mechanics im not entirely sure <SEP> but there certainly is a way for smart-contracts to put data on the blockchain, right? <SEP> a contract can only store what it already has defined in memory, and it cant be changed or manipulated once deployed <SEP> so it can store its own data and it can keep updating that data when you call it <SEP> also, from a financial perspective, is it better to run an entire program that doesn't need such massive decentralization as smart-contracts(gas costs are expensive, I heard)? <SEP> Gas is a cost to make up what the dev spends over and above the presale money <SEP> um sorry, I was under the impression that each operation of a smart-contract costs some amount of money, known as ""gas"" <SEP> is that not the case? <SEP> Can anyone change the notepad made by microsoft in the year 1994 <SEP> no? <SEP> as in, they can certainly change and release it in a later year, but not in 1994 <SEP> or was that not directed at me? <SEP> @goluhaque Im still new, so im not sure what is better or not, but from what i understand, every time you make a transaction it costs gas, as it re-runs your contracts again with the new data, ether you give it etc... <SEP> The main theme is Security in Ethereum, and a smart guy need not make a contract to save money, he can do it in simple logostic ways <SEP> the more modular you make your code for instance, the more gas intensive it will be <SEP> BRB i am burning some gas to cook my Chicken with the same spices and try to make it more tastier .. LOL <SEP> @xtac4u22 RE:  32-bit.   See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4b5l96/quick_breakdown_of_operating_systems_which_people/ for information on our current OS distribution.    There are a number of people asking for 32-bit support, but we have lots of work on our plate and we only have limited resources.    Most people using Ethereum right now **do** have 64-bit machines.    If individuals in the community want 32-bit support then we need them to step up and help.    Speaking for myself, outside of my work for the Foundation I am also doing work to bring Ethereum to mobile and wearable Linux, and all kinds of ""resource constrained devices"".   See http://doublethink.co.    All of my targets are 32-bit ARM.    If you can roll up your sleeves and build from source, this stuff is not impossible.   But it isn't trivial either.    Adding 32-bit support would mean doubling our build machine count.   It would cost real time and money to do.    So I'm sure we will get there.   It just isn't an immediate priority, because it only affects a subset of users.    We have numerous things which affect all existing users, and those have to have a priority.  As I think I've suggested before on this channel, perhaps somebody (you?) could try to get together a group of interested parties, either on Reddit, or maybe on the Ethereum Champions Slack, and put out a bounty for somebody to build and release 32-bit Windows binaries?     It doesn't **have** to be the Foundation doing the work. <SEP> another doubt guys: can a smart-contract pay ETH from a wallet to another users' wallet? <SEP> wouldn't that require the smart-contract to contain private key of the payer wallet(the wallet FROM which it pays), which can be seen by people who decompile the compiled smart-contract",how do smart-contracts run?

No notification is called to the receiver when ECR20 token are send to him ? <SEP> Not a contract <SEP> An erc20 isn't something in the Ethereum protocol. It's a self contained contract. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  so it's up to the implementation of the ECR20 interface if it will call something or nothing <SEP> Saying an erc20 send should notify the recepient contract is like saying all contracts should notify all contracts. <SEP> isn't it ? <SEP> To work between contracts, you should use approve and transferfrom <SEP> @kayabaNerve  I don't get it <SEP> *work with an erc20 between contracts. If you only need to know your balance, not verify who sent it, balance and transfer are good enough <SEP> Contracts don't contact each other like that.

You want the user to approve it, the contract to call transferfrom, and then the contract can either call approve and the user can call transferfrom, or the user can call withdraw and the contract can call transfer. <SEP> The big picture is to  move ECR20 tockens to another blockchain. So I need a contract that let the ECR20 owner to deposit and withdraw the tockens till a deadline. After the deadline all the tocken owned by the contract will be sent to a null address. <SEP> than I need a snapshot of who and the amount of the ECR20 in the contract to replicate the same distribution in the new blockchain <SEP> @kayabaNerve so the only way to archive it is not to the ECR20 owner to send to the contract, but the contract to transferFrom the ECR20 owner <SEP> ? <SEP> That's just an if statement; you should tie it to the block number over the time though. <SEP> Snapshot is easy. You don't even need a second contract for this. <SEP> 1) just snapshot and freeze the erc20. <SEP> 2) just snapshot the erc20 and tell people they're now worthless. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  ECR20 interface has not a freeze <SEP> 3) have people burn the tokens. <SEP> That doesn't mean your contract can't have one if it isn't already deployed. <SEP> And yes about the transferfrom <SEP> @kayabaNerve  it's already deploied <SEP> Then transferfrom/burn <SEP> @kayabaNerve  I am trying to let the user withdraw the tockens till the deadline. Imagine if the deadline is in 6 mouths and in 3 mounth tocken price is at 100x. <SEP> Maybe the user wants to sell them: so I need to burn the tocken at deadline .. not before <SEP> but it's not a must <SEP> So you can make a contract before hand that acts as a vault and stops access after X time; heck, I could make you one; or you can have users burn the tokens after the fact <SEP> and I need another smart contract cause I need the user to register the public key of the account in the new blockchain <SEP> to know where to sent the tockens to <SEP> I'd recommend making that the same over <SEP> Why make two contacts to lock come and <SEP> *lock coins and sign up when you can just have one overall for the new chain?",install smart contract - is there any function called in the receiving smart contract?

People are saying miners don't care about the gas fees. <SEP> gas price of 0 is possible? or is it now a gas price as percentage of transaction sum <SEP> It is possible. <SEP> but for creating a smart contract you need ether still? <SEP> ... nope. You need gas. You pay what you want for gas. <SEP> It was never 'needed'. <SEP> But you won't get your TX mined <SEP> It's a half truth. Ether is still needed. Even if miner's didn't care about the gas fees, everyone would have to switch for 0 gas fee TXs to be processed. <SEP> That said, miners do care. Gas fees surpass the block reward, last I checked. Increasing the block reward increases inflation. <SEP> so there is now the option to do transaction for 0 ether? <SEP> in theory but not practically <SEP> There always was, however, your TX won't be mined for a long time. <SEP> Gas prices incentive miners to mine your TX. With no incentive.. <SEP> and thats it but ether is still the gas of ethereum plattform? <SEP> Ether was never gas. It's a utility token to pay for gas. <SEP> jes and then people in social media showed up and said ether is going to drop <SEP> where did Vitalik say this?",how are transactions now feed on ethereum?

I am not sure about your project, but I believe that if it something you feel passionate about you  should do it. <SEP> @KenoLeon thank you for the quick reply. Definately something I am passionate about and we are working on but since the concept is similiar to that of Alibaba and Amazon wanted to see from a coding/developer perspective how difficult or easy it would be to pivot <SEP> I did not think it would be easy and since we are a startup could give us a huge first mover competitive advantage being a BlockChain based company.. The future is moving to BlockChain just a matter of time <SEP> also @KenoLeon  if interested I can send you some more info on the project <SEP> Hey Buddy! Check this out to get started on the spec. address An Ethereum address represents an account. For EOA, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account, e.g., cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826. This is a hexadecimal format (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by appending 0x to the address. Web3.js and console functions accept addresses with or without this prefix but for transparency we encourage their use. Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is 42 characters long. Several apps and APIs are also meant to implement the new checksum-enabled address scheme introduced in the Mist Ethereum wallet as of version 0.5.0. <SEP> remember you're building a Dapp on an existing blockchain.

It is a closed system, where your smart contracts run in a sandbox.   They can have their own state (stored on the blockchain), and can read and write to that, or call other smart contracts, but that's it.    Reading from a CSV is not possible, because they aren't only running locally.   You need to populate them with calls to them passing parameters.  http://solidity.readthedocs.org has all the info. <SEP> @bobbykennedy The 'JIT VM' for Geth has been in testing for several months and is significantly faster than the Interpreter.    It will likely be made the default soon enough.  A random selection of nodes are being defaulted to the JIT to get broader testing.   If you aren't comfortable with being one of those then you can switch it off as per the message.    If you've got further questions on that, head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum.
