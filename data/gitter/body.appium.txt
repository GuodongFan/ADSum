You create only one instance of the driver for all test cases, so if you have 2 test cases (login and logout test case), first test case will get you logged in and after this test case is finished you will stay logged in, logout test case starts from where first one finished, so you are still logged in, you just need to logout in second test case. Note that this way you can't run logout test case without login test case, test cases will be dependent on each other (at least in this case). Here is how I do it in Python, not sure which client you use:  ``` class BaseTest(object):     '''         This class deals with starting Appium server and setting the Matchbook app to the initial state     '''     _instance = None     def __new__(self):         if not self._instance:             self._instance = super(BaseTest, self).__new__(self)             self.driver = webdriver.Remote(config <SEP> Does anybody know where I can find the full documentation of the `mobile: *` interface? <SEP> @majdukovic Thanks for this info, i'll do a try  One more question: Are seeing appium settings pops up everytime on simulator while executing a test ? <SEP> I'm getting this error: Error occured while starting App. Original error: 'com.sample.android.activity.SplashActivity' never started"},"sessionId":null}" <SEP> com.sample.android.activity.SplashActivity The above activity is my launch-able activity, I can see the splash screen is pops up but why appium is throughs this error? <SEP> @sitansu_kar007_twitter can you see in appium logs  what is the first activity server sees? Maybe there is some activity before that one, you could use appWaitActivity in desired capabilities if you want to wait for that activity. Is there any pop up window before splash activity maybe? <SEP> @majdukovic No, the first activity is  com.sample.android.activity.SplashActivity <SEP> in the app, and it is a splash screen <SEP> I'm not using these caps since the latest appium version automatically recognise the appPackage and appActivity <SEP> Even I tried with these and got the same issues <SEP> it's better to be explicit rather then implicit, see here for apWaitActivity https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps/ (it mentions SplashActivity as an example). I'm using emulators. <SEP> @majdukovic I have fixed the issue by using below caps capabilities.setCapability("appWaitDuration", 3000);     capabilities.setCapability("noSign", true);     capabilities.setCapability("appWaitPackage", "com.sample.android");     capabilities.setCapability("appWaitActivity", "com.sample.android.splash");  Thanks Man!!!

If do we have any solution for that I will test which keyboard  present and will write Assert for Numeric one...If it is also not possible I will skip this. What do you suggest bro ? <SEP> to check which keyboard is pop up for the text field, I don't have any solution for now. You can search it on google to find out how you do it!

What to do, because finally the tests have to run on real devices. and it does not identify the elements there. <SEP> Hey Everyone. I have a weird problem with my Android testing in which the Appium server stops responding when actions are performed on a page for some time. Actually the exact query failure is random. Either find elements will fail, or scroll will fail or get page source will fail. But there is a limited number of actions I can perform. I am assuming it has got to do with recycler views in android, which might be causing the issue, but I am not sure.   For example, my app is an OTT one like Netflix with swim lanes for categories and multiple categories. So there is vertical scrolling for selecting a category and horizontal scrolling for selecting an asset in the category. If I find a category and then scroll the whole assets horizontally it fails in the validation of the next.  If I don't to any scrolling and validate assets in view and check all categories then it fails after some are validated.  Better if I just scroll up and down also for ten times, then the server gives up after 5-7 scrolls.  Really not sure what to do :-( <SEP> WebDriverException: Message: An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: Could not proxy command to remote server. Original error: Error: ESOCKETTIMEDOUT <SEP> My application has resource ID and cont-desc for most of the stuff. So not using Xpath. I am using Appium version 1.15.1 with python client version 0.50 and UiAutomator2. I have checked the issue and can reproduce it in old versions also.

<SEP> Anyone did work on Appium Server with Circle CI?   So far I installed Appium via the node in CI server, installed mvn dependencies.  Now when I'm starting appium as a node command ``` appium & ``` it's now doing anything and skipping that part running my code and throwing exception about the server not started.   I'm working on for iOS automation and doing in Mac CI image from Circle CI.  Can anyone help me here, I'm stuck here for the past 5 days. <SEP> Hey - just a general question (not a JS expert, so probably something trivial and easy that I just don't know!) - I'm not sure why appium v. 1.17.0 gets appium-windows-driver v.1.8.0, yet the earlier release of appium 1.17.0-beta.1 gets the newer version of appium-windows-driver (v.1.11.0)? <SEP> Ah - I seem to have answered my own question - npm shrinkwrap has forced the version to 1.8.0... <SEP> A lot of the versions seem to be behind, including the base driver.  How can I update these?  Otherwise I am stuck on the version 1.17.0-beta.1, despite later releases using older dependencies? <SEP> Here's a gist of a wrong match by the selenium server... https://gist.github.com/jsa34/5a747005af22b85d2f0f88c39f64e30b  How can I distinguish explicitly between the requests for selenium server to funnel the requests as expected?

For example, I have an input field that only accepts numeric characters, any other special characters besides allowed characters are not sent to the field no matter what users pressing on the keyboard itself.  I try to use 'Send Keys' function and then assert the input field's text equals blank (input values are not filled), but Appium can still send the restricted characters successfully. <SEP> @zarashima   To be honest: 1. this should be a unit test and not a UI test, because this is very time consuming. It also needs to be an API test, because people can still adjust frontend code (if it's a frontend app) and send different chars through the API 2. it's also good to know how the filtering is done, if this is done for example with HTML and a specific attribute, like for example ` <SEP> ok thanks @wswebcreation <SEP> Hello Guys, I am facing one issue, I want to clear the content from text field. I Have used clear() but this method did not clear the field value. Means the focus of cursor is going in first position instead of last position. So is there any other way to clear textfield text. <SEP> A good start without having to do a lot is by using WebdriverIO <SEP> They have a boilerplate to get started, see https://github.com/webdriverio/appium-boilerplate <SEP> @wswebcreation ok,thanks <SEP> Anyone facing this issue while executing parallelly tests for Android: Original error: Could not proxy command to remote server.

What would be anticipated capacity of server should be ! any guess?  2) I am trying to develop a framework to run android and ios automation in one unique framework. Can i run the appium server with one port for whole parallel execution <SEP> 3) Is it possible to programmtically to invoke the appium server ;  4) What would be best test report generator ; i am trying to use Extent Report ideally. How can i add test step info in extent report ?  I know these topics are very vast; but short answer would allows me to do some study and implement the same <SEP> Not a problem!, For #1, You can do it but you would be pushing it with 16GB of memory on a laptop. I also would highly suggest that after you do this to let a vendor handle the infrastructure, there's a ton of maintenance involved . I would say Bitbar is the best, Sauce is by far the best overall but there's a very big price tag with it. <SEP> For 2. I havent done this but I dont see why not. Should be able to do it by creating another appium session on a different port. <SEP> For 3, yes, just invoke it via terminal command before running the test and setting it up. It really should be done by some CI server. <SEP> For 4. I highly recommend checking out Allure, I havent used Extent so I cannot give you the pros and cons but I like how simple Allure is. <SEP> okay thanks for your time @Edge-Man <SEP> @kamaleshrnp Not a problem, any other questions feel free to DM me. I have a ton of experience with what you are doing. <SEP> Do you have any documentation for running Jenkins configuration to our automation test scripts <SEP> There's a bunch of tutorials out there <SEP> let me find a good one. <SEP> @Edge-Man  Wow ! thats really appreciated <SEP> I am trying to do a DM ; but i dont  know how to do in this chat portal:) <SEP> Just click on my profile icon and you will see "Chat Privately" <SEP> Cool

<SEP> hey guys, for appium which locator strategy would u suggest is the best..? <SEP> like in selenium, CSS seemed like a better and generic locator strategy.

<SEP> Hi, is it possible to run selenium webdriver test cases using appium? <SEP> My target browser is safari in ios (iPhone and IPad) <SEP> hello. I'm using Appium and genymotion in order to test my app. I've two devices launched. I've setup 2 appium servers (!= port, !=bootstrap port etc ), and a selenium grid. My appium script is written with python and py.test. When i run my test, it runs on the first device and when the first test is done, it run on the second device. How can I run my tests on the two devices at the same time ? With java and testng, i know there is a variable parallel=true in the testng.xml, but I don't know how to do that with Python. thanks.
<SEP> :) <SEP> lol... had to make the session private and kick who ever joined out sense they didnt ask..... anyways good luck testing the resetApp works great on iOS my issue is sometimes it works and sometimes it does not work like I want it to on android <SEP> iOS it does reset the whole sim, but as long as the caps is set to --no-reset it wont reset all data, now if you app logs you out when a app closes and repoens thats a session issue on your app/server

Here is my setup() function:  ```          capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.safari();         capabilities.setCapability("automationName", "XCUITest");         capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "iOS");         capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "11.2.2");         capabilities.setCapability("deviceName", "iPad Air");         capabilities.setCapability("udid", "*udid of device*");         capabilities.setCapability("browserName", "Safari");         capabilities.setCapability("launchTimeout", 120000000);                   URL url = new URL("http://*IP*/hub"); //IP Address of Appium Server         driver = new RemoteWebDriver(url, capabilities);         driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(25, TimeUnit.SECONDS); ``` <SEP> @JacopoFerrazza lets say you have 2 fields username and password. When you enter username you can't see password field because keyboard is displayed, in Python I would do something like this: ``` self.driver.find_element_by_id('username').send_keys(username) self.driver.hide_keyboard() self.driver.find_element_by_id('password').send_keys(password) ``` <SEP> @pattraynor You need to build Safari. It requires Xcode. <SEP> @Asimk21 So I need to set my team xcodeOrgId, xcodeSigningId to iPhone Developer only? Or do I need another compatibility "app" and set it to 'Safari' as well? <SEP> There is a SafariLauncher.xcodeproj in appium. Open project in xcode and set appropriate signing identities <SEP> @pattraynor in addtion to xcodeOrgId, xcodeSigningId, and iPhone Developer, I think if the app is already installed,  you only need`bundleID` and `appName`, if not installed, you also need `app` and point to the path your .ipa located and appium will install it to the device from there. <SEP> @pattraynor if you test browser, you need `"browserName":"safari"`, otherwise if you test native app, don't need that. <SEP> This is my capability set for safari: {   "appiumVersion": "1.7.2",   "platformName": "iOS",   "platformVersion": "11.2",   "deviceName": "iPhone",   "waitforTimeout": 3000,   "udid": "3DC9D2D7-3557-43CA-807A-6343C2CA1BF3",   "browserName": "safari" } <SEP> This is capability set example for native app: <SEP> ``` {   "appiumVersion": "1.7.2",   "platformName": "iOS",   "platformVersion": "11.2",   "deviceName": "iPhone",   "waitforTimeout": 3000,   "udid": "4CCB5322-5D2F-44B2-AB60-E209251773D4",   "appName": "UICatalog",   "bundleId": "com.ac.apple-samplecode.UICatalog",   "xcodeOrgId": "2Z6WHFP5Q3",   "xcodeSigningId": "iPhone Developer" } ``` <SEP>  @JacopoFerrazza lets say you have 2 fields username and password. When you enter username you can't see password field because keyboard is displayed, in Python I would do something like this: ``` self.driver.find_element_by_id('username').send_keys(username) self.driver.hide_keyboard() self.driver.find_element_by_id('password').send_keys(password) ``` @majdukovic thank you so much man! <SEP> I dont know if appium supports pararell testing, you should look for it on the docs to see if there's something about it http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/intro/ <SEP> @Sergio_Rios__twitter  yes can work with it <SEP> @Sergio_Rios__twitter  we can work with two application at a time in iOS but u need to do different setup <SEP> Hi Can we take bound values to find out an element in android app using appium ? <SEP> if so, can any body tell the syntax

<SEP> Hi seeing this error in Appium, can anyone help <SEP> MJSONWP <SEP> @andythompson89 are you using iOS simulator or real device? <SEP> @all has anyone worked on the latest mobile commands for iOS  using appium: mobile:touchAndHold I am facing an issue to simulate the longPress action <SEP> @andythompson89 I think ipa files are meant for actual devices. For simulators you would need .app file <SEP> Ah cool I wasn't aware of that, thank you... I'll try that approach <SEP> I recall looking for that file a while ago and not being able to find it. Would you be able to point me in the direction of a folder structure that i can look in on the build device? <SEP> @andythompson89 Are you using xcode to build the code? <SEP> @Abriti15 the build is initiated in xamarin on a windows pc then builds on a mac mini in xcode <SEP> @andythompson89 I believe the xcode build gets generated for a real device...but it tries to install it on a simulator...can u try connecting to a real device and pass on the capabilities instead of a simulator <SEP> I have faced similar issue while trying to run an ipa code on a simulator <SEP> OK I can try that, thanks for the info... Any idea how we should be building it if we intend to run tests on an emulator? <SEP> @andythompson89 I do it from xcode directly...U can select the device against the app and build the code...it will generate .app file...either for a real device or simulator.

<SEP> Hi all,  guessing someone has solved this : trying to build a page scroll method for my appium based tests.

You could use touch actions and manually scroll. <SEP> That video was a good thing to see, using the UI automator with its built in scrolling to get to an element might work!

So if I start my Iphone test case first , it runs fine in Iphone. Next when I trigger Ipad test , appium.io opens in Iphone , and then the test opens in Ipad and after the test runs , the appium.io in Iphone closes and the browser in Ipad remains open. Does anyone know as to how i can resolve this issue These are my commands  1. Open Terminal window 2. execute appium/bin/ios-webkit-debug-proxy-launcher.js -c iOSdeviceidentity:debugportnumber -d 3. Open another Terminal window 4. export REMOTE_DEBUGGER_PORT=debugportnumber 5. appium -p -bp -udid  ---webkit-debug-proxy <SEP> As someone with no previous JS experience, is anyone able to provide some good tutorials for webdriver.io?

Although you might encounter like I'm currently encountering. The porting isn't simple. <SEP> @Neph0 it should work <SEP> Thanks @Neph0 and @mgmanikandan87, I appreciate those quick replies.

<SEP> Hello Team, Currently I m facing an error with ios webkit debug proxy. Can someone help me resolving this? Issue: <SEP> WebKit debugger got a message for 'Console.enable' and have no handler, doing nothing.  <SEP> I just finished automating the Amazon Fire Stick. Should probably be the same for the Fire TV. Does anyone have experience with Roku or Apple TV with Appium? <SEP> I am in trouble because Appium can not be used.  1. Start up Appium. 2. Press Start Server v1.8.1 button. 3. Select New Session Window. 4. Select Automatic Server. 5. Set up Disabled Capabilities. 6. Press the Start Session button.  The following error message is displayed  "The server refuse to browse the page. The URL or other input may not be correct. Please confirm the value.  URL: http: // localhost: 4723 / wd / hub / session ERROR: CONNECT (localhost: 4723) / connect: Connection refused "  When you run appium-doctor -ios you will see "Everything looks good, bye!" so I think Appium settings are done.  Why does the above error appear when I press the Start Session button?  A similar error message is displayed whether you connect iphone to Mac or not. <SEP> how to click an element in mobile using appium code? <SEP>  I am using Nodejs with Appium on a native iOS app.  Im currently trying to setup my tests to enable some console reporting and assertions. I wasnt sure on the best frameworks to use for this, so I have been trialling different ones. Im currently trying to get Mocha/Chai working and have also even tried some chai-as-promised.  My main issue is that as soon as I run the test using npm run ios (a shortcut from my package.json), my tests instantly pass, even though my simulator hasnt even yet loaded the app up. If I have an assertion in there, then it instantly fails as it states the result is pending. Ive tried playing around with different forms of assertions and expect statements and also moving them to different places (as well as adding a beforeEach)  Here is my code:  const wdio = require('webdriverio'); const caps = {"platformName":"iOS","platformVersion":"11.4","deviceName":"iPhone 8","app":"/Users/xxx.app","automationName":"XCUITest"}; const driver = wdio.remote({   protocol: "http",   host: "localhost",   port: 4723,   path: "/wd/hub",   desiredCapabilities: caps });  var expect = require('chai').expect; //var assert = require('chai').assert;  var chai = require('chai'); var chaiAsPromised = require('chai-as-promised'); chai.Should(); chai.use(chaiAsPromised); chaiAsPromised.transferPromiseness = driver.transferPromiseness;  describe("Onboarding Login Test Desc", function () {  it("Onboarding Login Test It", function(){ driver.init()   .waitForVisible("~btn_onboarding_right_action")   .pause(1000)   .touchAction( <SEP> @simongilmurray  Don't use the standalone version, but the testrunner, by the way, this looks like a promise thingy <SEP> @wswebcreation sorry what do you mean by the testrunner?

To work with simulator use .app file of project instead of .ipa. I hope this will work, Do let me know <SEP> Hi guys. I am working with appium and a set  of Real device:Android and iOS. <SEP> I would works with Many devices...and I nerd <SEP> Sorry I nerd <SEP> Need (t9 issue) <SEP> A professional USB hub. <SEP> Have some suggestion for me? <SEP> Still having a real issue trying to get assertions working using Mocha/Chai on a Nodejs webdriverio automated iOS test via Appium.  I've tried implementing expects, adding "done();" to the it statements as per someone's suggestion, but everytime I run the test , it immediately prints out that the tests have passed even before they have run (they then continue to run as expected). I'm not sure if this is some async issue, I have also tried utilising promises but not had any luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

You can get the x and y position of the element which you can verify against where you expect it to be. I don't think appium has this function written but it wouldn't be hard to write yourself since any get element function get's it's x and y position. A verify method is actually redundant because you would provide static x and y coordinates which would change device to device assuming your application is device independant

I noticed that it seems to have something to do with my selenium grid setup. When I split the devices over two hubs there is no problem to run them all at the same time. So no issue with appium. Maybe its because I host the selenium hubs in docker? Who knows. I split it up to 4 different selenium grids now and will hand them one out to each team.  Its no biggie. Its good since the teams will have dedicated devices anyways, and this way there is no possibility to accidentially occupy another teams devices. <SEP> @here is it possible to use appium:fullReset with react-native?

If using WebdriverIO, in your assertion, please locate the element using string selector and return the element object. With the element object, you can manage to call the click action. Hope this could help. <SEP> hi @shay-bracha In short, I think it's rather difficult to get the device dimensions from Appium.

Sorry I forgot that you mentioned your app is built with react native.

<SEP> yeh it's just a GUI wrapper on top of Appium, which is why you can use it to attach onto existing appium server sessions to run your inspector <SEP> sort of like a Selenium IDE, but a very cut down version, still allows you to do basic record actions - better than nothing I guess <SEP> ya, i thought so :) just an opinion guys <SEP> Just want to hear your opinion -- <SEP> don't want to debate but I'm using Robot Framework (open source) + appium to manage automation scripts on mobile <SEP> Is there somekind listing of all "good" frameworks? <SEP> depends <SEP> ok, is there a list of possible frameworks? <SEP> no generic solution available.. since its very subjective question.. each app is different..so develop ur own.. instead of getting openion from people <SEP> - budget - which kind of application that you want to test - ect <SEP> there are some frameworks out there, Robot framework is an example, beside that, there are some more frameworks such as: cucumber <SEP> or you can even use TestNG / protractor / <SEP> I'm just trying to do presentation about test frameworks what you can use with appium <SEP> actually <SEP> Appium is designed in the theory: "independent programming language" <SEP> framework is just a set of rules that the man who use it should follow them <SEP> To be simple one should develop his own framework by using tools like appium <SEP> Handling the chrome browser in web application and in mobile are the both same, mean the same  ChromeDriver will it work ? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter I may be misinterpreting, but you'll have to use iOS/Android driver depending on the platform you want to test, then set your 'app' capability to the Chrome app on the device <SEP> hmm, under the hood, either web application or mobile web application will use selenium server to handle & execute event/action So the idea is they have the same 'core' even if you are performing the automation scripts on desktop browser/mobile browser But you know, the behavior in the mobile is always like is it on desktop browser! So you need to modify your scripts in order to make it works <SEP> @siggerzz , thanks for writing to me, u mean once we are able to launch the chrome, go to any website or search some thing rest of all are same as how we do with WebDriver ?? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter correct <SEP> its clear, Thanks to @minhnguyenphuonghoang  , @siggerzz <SEP> Usually in POM, we maintain the classes as per pages. in this if pages are more classes may be more, instead of this why can't we maintain the set of few classes in form of methods to cover all the functionalities of all the pages and call those methods from your tests, in this way we can reduce the number of classes and we can remember even the classes too since we have few, why we wont prefer this way ??? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter You got to think of people working on it in the future. It's easier to maintain if you have the methods for a specific page in a class dedicated to that page <SEP> @siggerzz , yes it may be crt but there is chance to have some common functionalities in more than one page assume with same id/name, in this case in POM we will write a function in all the pages to handle it, here we are missing the reuseability , is not it <SEP> You can use a 'BasePage' class <SEP> and have your pages inherit it <SEP> Then just declare all the common functionality in the BaseClass and call the method in the pages that need it

<SEP> Hi all, I would like to start using appium and maybe someone can help me with one clarification: App have iOS part and Web part (as different modules). Can appium in same test cover iOS app THEN swich to browser and check something THEN go back to iOS app? <SEP> * Web browser can be opened on that apple phone, different apple phone or even on Desktop which is (USB) connected to apple phone. I just need to know is this possible at all? <SEP> @dragantd_twitter You should be able to switch context (Native to web or vice versa) on same device. <SEP> Thank you for the answer.
<SEP> Hi friends, i want to execute my appium scripts to cloud level device execution. how to execute cloud level execution?? i am new to appium please help me friends <SEP> What do you mean by cloud level device execution? @seenuchiranjeevi <SEP> for example, if i start execute appium script from my MAC machine or windows machine. My script should connect and execute with set off devices(android/ios real devices) in cloud(amazon or any other) @Asimk21 <SEP> it will run ur automation remotlt <SEP> thank you @priyankshah217 . so should i use any one of these sausce labs or testroid cloud licensed tool to perform my appium script execution remotely? <SEP> @seenuchiranjeevi As  @priyankshah217 mentioned + There are  free units available on few cloud tools. Few cloud services defeats the purpose (language independent) of appium. So, just check in documentation before going forward. <SEP> hi @Asimk21 i also need some of free cloud tools. I have googled about free cloud tools for appium but i could not get it. may i know any of best and free appium cloud tools?

I only call 'launch' once in my appium client <SEP> @hardik-d yes but then I need to guess an element that has no action. <SEP> no need to guess, click on some logo or picture or something. Not everything is clickable <SEP> ok - not exactly what I want but seems the only way <SEP> yes, usually you enter some text and take some other action like submit a button or verify other elements etc. <SEP> hope you are not trying to hide the keyboard or some <SEP> the problem with is that you need to click twice <SEP> at least when a text box has focus <SEP> is someone here using appium with react native? Does you experience difficulties getting elements by accessibility strategy? It seems that testID etc. behaves differently between iOS and Android <SEP> Is Appium 1.6.3 supposed to be able to run multiple Android emulators concurrently assuming I use separate Appium server instances? <SEP> Whenever I try to do it, Appium just cannot seem to handle it. For example, one server instance is supposed to handle one emulator but then it telnets into the other emulator or something. <SEP> Maybe that's not even it, but it tries to do something with both emulators. <SEP> Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not) <SEP> Not just that. I actually cannot even reliably run tests on two different emulators sequentially. <SEP> Sometimes works, sometimes not <SEP> All these problems lead me to think that Appium is not meant to support it, even through I have read various places that one can do it anyway. <SEP> i used to do it previously <SEP> haven't tried on 1.6.3 <SEP> "Despite using different server ports, bootstrap ports, chromedriver ports, even UDID (whether it makes a difference or not)" this is must <SEP> $ appium -p 4754 -bp 4756 -U "192.168.56.101:5555" --chromedriver-port 9527 // -p is appium port, -bp is bootstrap port, -U is UDID for emulators, --chromedriver-port // to get UDID for genymotion emulators, launch desired emulator then type below: $ adb devices // finally launch tests by passing in additional params $ PORT=4754 UDID=192.168.56.101:5555 PLATFORM=android rspec -b appium_test <SEP> Thanks for replying <SEP> this is what has worked before <SEP> check the ports i am using <SEP> they have to be 10# apart from one instance to another <SEP> Hmm. Isn't -U the same as --udid ? <SEP> ofcourse i use UDID and PORT in my caps <SEP> Sorry <SEP> yes but you start your server and tell it the UDID and have to tell your test code the same <SEP> When I run my tests, I have emulators with UDID "emulator-5554" and "emulator-5556".

<SEP> hi <SEP> i am a newbie and was just trying out basic stuff, the first step every tutorial mentions is the use of desired capabilities <SEP> since that is now deprecated, what should i use <SEP> Pp <SEP> . <SEP> Any one worked on getting network calls for iOS app ? <SEP> @manojleo06 I'm also new and tried appium with webdriverio client which seemed so interesting, but honestly it gave me a headache cz documentation is broken and on every update many stuff are broken...they have a channel though which you could communicate through ... so i preferred to move to Java client for which you can find many courses on Udemy <SEP> But webdriverio is interesting if you can find out ur way <SEP> @manojleo06 there is a boilerplate https://github.com/webdriverio/appium-boilerplate/ <SEP> https://webdriver.io/docs/boilerplate.html#webdriverio-appium-boilerplate-https-githubcom-webdriverio-appium-boilerplate <SEP> Yes I checked those <SEP> But for example i tried a lot to create multiple drivers, ios/android/browser, which i want to use all 3 from the same test but i couldn't <SEP> The documentation for multiple drivers didn't work <SEP> saw this in the appium.log: ^ <SEP> Appium+cucumber is best choice? <SEP> @siddu09 Hi Team,  I need to automate car  car device(Embeded app) app appium can be great choice if yes ..which is the best framework to use?

<SEP> :) <SEP> welcome <SEP> @cbiermannIMVU I just sent you a message in private. Let me know if you want some other options to solve your issue. <SEP> Hey has anyone tried parallel execution using Appium for Android devices? <SEP> I believe we need to use Selenium Grid for this to work <SEP> @cbiermannIMVU at least u can one batch file for starting apium server from command line, then they can start batch file and run the test cases... <SEP> create.. <SEP> @propaul  yes of course you need to selenium grid to run parallel execution
<SEP> ! <SEP> Hello Team,  I am using newly released updated appium desktop version (1.7.1) to inspect android mobile elements in the emulator (Android Version - 7.1.1) ;  In a particular screen, it shows me the *parser error* in the inspector. Attaching the screenshot for more reference! Do anyone have come across this issue. I read a lot of blogs, where they have a suggestion to either upgrade or downgrade the version ; I tried even with appium 1.6.2; Android Studio (3.2.1);  *Environment:- * appium desktop version (1.7.1) appium 1.6.2;  Android Studio (3.2.1)   *Trials:-* I checked the appium logs , it says me Parser Error in a couple of places.  The build, which i got it earlier from developers were showing the mobile elements perfectly ! But only this particular apk shows this one!  I am really struck with this issue , to keen in whether its an build issue or my appium issue <SEP> Try using Appiums getSourcePage api to compate <SEP> *compare <SEP> eg. System.out.println(wd.getPageSource()); <SEP> wd is driver <SEP> @Edge-Man I am trying to just view the mobile elements; Just invoking the app using appium desktop manually <SEP> okay ! I will to do it . I dont have idea; it works perfectly for other builds <SEP> Thanks @Edge-Man <SEP> it's likely a change then the developer made that broke it <SEP> Ya tried asking them to debug their source code, but i got an answer ; No change <SEP> thats always the case.... haha <SEP> best of luck but yes something did change. <SEP> I tried with all appium desktop version too! but nothing resolved this <SEP> I'd look at the Android Manifest or the area where the labels or ids are stored/created <SEP> @Edge-Man  I just received an apk file ; looked at the view of the tree using android studio; its very clear over there <SEP> interesting <SEP> ! <SEP> likely the & is screwing it up <SEP> Which one you are saying <SEP> at which place
<SEP> yeh it's just a GUI wrapper on top of Appium, which is why you can use it to attach onto existing appium server sessions to run your inspector <SEP> sort of like a Selenium IDE, but a very cut down version, still allows you to do basic record actions - better than nothing I guess <SEP> ya, i thought so :) just an opinion guys <SEP> Just want to hear your opinion -- <SEP> don't want to debate but I'm using Robot Framework (open source) + appium to manage automation scripts on mobile <SEP> Is there somekind listing of all "good" frameworks? <SEP> depends <SEP> ok, is there a list of possible frameworks? <SEP> no generic solution available.. since its very subjective question.. each app is different..so develop ur own.. instead of getting openion from people <SEP> - budget - which kind of application that you want to test - ect <SEP> there are some frameworks out there, Robot framework is an example, beside that, there are some more frameworks such as: cucumber <SEP> or you can even use TestNG / protractor / <SEP> I'm just trying to do presentation about test frameworks what you can use with appium <SEP> actually <SEP> Appium is designed in the theory: "independent programming language" <SEP> framework is just a set of rules that the man who use it should follow them <SEP> To be simple one should develop his own framework by using tools like appium <SEP> Handling the chrome browser in web application and in mobile are the both same, mean the same  ChromeDriver will it work ? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter I may be misinterpreting, but you'll have to use iOS/Android driver depending on the platform you want to test, then set your 'app' capability to the Chrome app on the device <SEP> hmm, under the hood, either web application or mobile web application will use selenium server to handle & execute event/action So the idea is they have the same 'core' even if you are performing the automation scripts on desktop browser/mobile browser But you know, the behavior in the mobile is always like is it on desktop browser! So you need to modify your scripts in order to make it works <SEP> @siggerzz , thanks for writing to me, u mean once we are able to launch the chrome, go to any website or search some thing rest of all are same as how we do with WebDriver ?? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter correct <SEP> its clear, Thanks to @minhnguyenphuonghoang  , @siggerzz <SEP> Usually in POM, we maintain the classes as per pages. in this if pages are more classes may be more, instead of this why can't we maintain the set of few classes in form of methods to cover all the functionalities of all the pages and call those methods from your tests, in this way we can reduce the number of classes and we can remember even the classes too since we have few, why we wont prefer this way ??? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter You got to think of people working on it in the future. It's easier to maintain if you have the methods for a specific page in a class dedicated to that page <SEP> @siggerzz , yes it may be crt but there is chance to have some common functionalities in more than one page assume with same id/name, in this case in POM we will write a function in all the pages to handle it, here we are missing the reuseability , is not it <SEP> You can use a 'BasePage' class <SEP> and have your pages inherit it <SEP> Then just declare all the common functionality in the BaseClass and call the method in the pages that need it
<SEP> Hi this is not an appium question but is related. In order to be able to use appium on a linux machine I had to install linuxbrew... and so on. It was at least painfull... besides that I stumble into an issue... a rather odd one i can do use all tools like adb... except the most important one uiautomatorviewer <SEP> can someone help me the error I get is Error: Could not find or load main class com.android.uiautomator.UiAutomatorViewer <SEP> which is strange... all is in its right place (At least I did not change a thing)

If it is, I'm not using node. I've downloaded the Windows appimum GUI. The issues I am having come under the section heading "Additional Setup for Android App Testing". Particularly, bullet number 2.  It says "Install the Android SDK. Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to be your Android SDK path and add the tools and platform-tools folders to your PATH variable." <SEP> I have downloaded Android studio, which apparently includes the SDK. (According to Google's page). But, on Windows, I am not sure what the Android SDK path should be set too. I can't find a directory called 'tools' or 'platform-tools' <SEP> u need set Android home path..sdk will be available after installation of android studio..like c:/users/name/appdata/local/ <SEP> @ddmee <SEP> @tekisrinivas20  ahh, cool. That's great. Thanks for that. I did not know that it was in appdata <SEP> cheers ;_)

<SEP> @lionel-pushios you'll want to make requests to the appium server.

<SEP> Hi there. I'm new to Appium. Went through docs and examples and didn't find such things as lazy search and something like control flow like webdriverJS has. Is there anything like that? <SEP> As I understand I have to initialize driver and search for elements only with it. That makes it really difficult to use such patterns as Page Elements and Page Object or any other organization of abstraction levels to make framework flexible and extendable. Are there some docs or examples regarding my question? Thanks in advance <SEP> In the latest appium 5.0.4 and selenium 3.7.1 there is no driver output in console while execution of test automation. Have any solution to show the console values? like finding Elements like that....
<SEP> ! <SEP> I'm having issues on accepting this iOS alert. Has anyone had success with it? <SEP> Already tried basic things like, switchTo().alert().accept() <SEP> @Joskony try and set the `autoAcceptAlerts` capability to `true` <SEP> It's a valid iOS capability (see `https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md`) I'm not sure if it works though, as I've never tried it
<SEP> Hi... One quick question...Can we automate iOS applications without debug/signed iPad file using Appium tool? <SEP> My bad it is ipa and not iPad* <SEP>   @sumit_bhuddi_twitter : Were you able to launch the App via RecentyApp ??? You can refer `https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html#KEYCODE_APP_SWITCH` and use this code  `driver.pressKeyCode('keycode-value')`to switchApp ie. recentyApps

I think you could do it with bash commands: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26830617/java-running-bash-commands <SEP> Guys, what the best approach to implement logging in to appium(ruby) framework? as I understand - there is no access to appium server logs, and it is unable to put them in to file, with framework specific messages. I'm looking for a way to capture driver level logs(i.e. clicking on elements, waiting etc) and save them to log files.  including logger in to framework methods - looks like not the best approach. <SEP> @brbrr  Hi, I'm using windows OS for Appium <SEP> @Rohithnm ok, anyway, you got the point. run it from os env. <SEP> google is a fancy thing <SEP> this is the first result <SEP> https://discuss.appium.io/t/launching-and-stopping-appium-server-programmtically/700 <SEP> @brbrr  Thanks <SEP> @Simon-Kaz  But it  not working for me :(\ <SEP>  <SEP> is it possible to retrieve an element with its index and resource-id , like :                                  findByXpath("//* <SEP>  findByXpath("//* <SEP> that should work <SEP> Thank you, I just realized that I was mixing Xpath and CSS3 selectors .... <SEP> which test cloud works best with appium? <SEP> How can we run test on android version  <SEP> it supports but id used by selendroid and id used by uiautomator are different <SEP> so script will not work, if you just choose capability to selendroid <SEP> Thanks @priyankshah217 : When i take the screenshot in uiautomator it doesnot show me the resource id in 4.2 version, so how can i make the same script work on previous versions of devices? <SEP> you need to use annotations @FindByAll() within that you can provide locators whichever applicable <SEP> i have sample code let me share link to you <SEP> ok..thanks <SEP> https://github.com/appium/sample-code/blob/master/sample-code/examples/java/junit/src/test/java/com/saucelabs/appium/page_object/android/ApiDemosListViewScreenSimple.java <SEP> you can combine multiple locators and try <SEP> ok so basically we are specifying in case you dont find the id, try searching by some other locator etc <SEP> Thanks Priyank <SEP> is it possible to set some click position offset?

My test script runs fine locally and I find the elements I need to interact with but when I run the same script in our "production" environment the WebView that I should be able to interact with is not even returned in the page source. Our production environment consists of a Selenium Hub with nodes for iOS, Android, and various browser nodes for web testing. Our iOS nodes are made up of several machines each with two appium nodes running on separate ports connected to the hub.   I compared the XML returned in the page source from both the test running locally and the test running on the hub. The test running on the hub is missing the entire XCUIElementTypeWebView section in the XML.  I spun up a hub locally and connected an iOS node just like we do in our production environment (identical node config and default capabilities) and could not reproduce the missing XCUIElementTypeWebView issue. The only difference that I can see right now between running in our production environment verse spinning up the hub locally, is that the tests are executed on a different machine than that of the node -- not sure if this matters.  Looking at the Appium doc I see this note, so maybe the connection is not being established in our production environment?   <SEP> Hi All, Is there anyone tried to automate scroll on native android context.

Nice to see you all! Finally, I found here, the appium discussion group! <SEP> @rkba92 till now i haven't faced any scenarios based on location. <SEP> i dont appium can access getlocation on real devices.. <SEP> its possible on emulators <SEP> @rkba92 You need to get the location of device or else set the location on device?? <SEP> get the location of device <SEP> @saikrishna321  how can that be achieved in Emulators? As Emulators wont be having any location <SEP> @Rohithnm  get the location of device <SEP> As I know, appium can NOT get the device's location, but you can set its location. <SEP> But how long it takes after the location is set, it's a question, I've never use this function before. <SEP> @rkba92 can you just explain me the scenario. so why you want to get the device location?? <SEP> @Rohithnm  The scenario is this.. We people are developing a geofence functionality in one of our app, Need to test that functionality  by automating it. <SEP>  App : Hotel App - Hotel keeps track of the delivery boy location as they could find the efficiency. Concept : The Delivery location would be set, If the delivery boys comes within 50 meter radius then the time would be noted and After leaving the 50 meter radius the time would be noted. These records would we used to calculate the efficiency of the delivery boy. Help Needed : To automate this concept in Android app, I will have to change the GPS location of the device. How can I acheive this?. Need inputs from all side. <SEP> @Amituowan_twitter  Thanks for your input <SEP> @Rohithnm  Waiting for ur response, How can I automate such situation <SEP> by send http request if the app 's code is designed with gets a device's location by http requests.
<SEP> Hello <SEP> Can we run automation scripts with signed APK <SEP> because I have tried on signed apk my all test scripts got failed <SEP> but on debug its running fine <SEP> Is `UiAutomator` installed on phone or it comes with `AndroidSDK`? <SEP> Hi , is it mandatory to use appium studio in future ? <SEP> how much stable is the free version of appium studio ? <SEP> Hi, does anyone know if it is possible to configure appium to use a different, new simulator for every e2e test file? Best case would be multiple simulators parallel (maybe with a max number of simulators), but sequentially would be fine. <SEP> @mahnuh Possibly yes. You could write a testng test (or similar) which run in parallel and invoke different simulator every time. You might need to start different appium server for every test. Note that this would increase execution time a lot. <SEP> @Asimk21 Ok. Is it possible to kill and restart the simulator after every test? <SEP> Yes, you can try and reset simulator/device using capability `reset=true` <SEP> actually its `noReset=false` <SEP> https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md <SEP> No u dont need to start different appium server <SEP> start single server and multiple client requests can be handled <SEP> @saikrishna321 Is it using different capabilities in each test? <SEP> and possibly `--session-override` ?? <SEP> no dont override the sessions <SEP> https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/advanced-concepts/parallel-tests.md#parallel-android-tests <SEP> check this <SEP> Cool. Thanks!! <SEP> @Asimk21 Thanks, I already tried noReset. The thing is, I am looking for specs with this in my config: specs:  <SEP> @mahnuh Then I guess you need to kill/close simulator every time AfterTest and start simulator in BeforeTest. <SEP> @Asimk21 Okay, thanks! <SEP> Hi all, there was a problem, the appium does not exist given xpath: //android.widget.LinearLayout <SEP> Hi All,Am doing mobile automation for IOS app using appium desktop..am not able to automate select picker wheel option where we can select a value from dropdown.Any help/suggestions would be much appreciated.Thanks. <SEP> How can I interact with alert in iOS?

I haven't ran into this issue as I'm using the PageFactoryLocators so my tests cache the page elements I know we are looking for. <SEP> Interesting <SEP> but to initialize the object takes around 4-5 minutes <SEP> How are you interacting with the alert via javascript? <SEP> and calling the Click method also takes that much time <SEP> Are you coding fully in Javascript with your framework? <SEP> with javascript is way faster, but not reliable at all <SEP> no no <SEP> using Java? <SEP> I think I'm using js only for native alerts and scrolling in webviews <SEP> Yeah, the javacript stuff I have found is not stable. I always try to use the same language as my whole framework as much as possible and that's why I use Java since that's what's most stable. <SEP> As a workaround you could try the C# version of this <SEP> @iOSXCUITFindBy(iOSNsPredicate = "type == 'XCUIElementTypeStaticText' AND name == 'Location Access Disabled' AND visible == 1")

Just want to know your personal opinion on the matter. <SEP> @mminhaz93 Can you do it manually? If not, then appium would also not do it.

<SEP> Hi <SEP> I wan exact code of how to swipe scroll using appium.I tried with Java script executor.But it didnt worked out <SEP> do not use java script.. try with TouchActions <SEP> https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/touch-actions.md <SEP> hi , is i need to install ruby  too <SEP> if ruby is not installed in ubuntu, then yes.. <SEP> ruby u can install using apt-get <SEP> Hi could u share me the code .Let me know wht changes required for below : <SEP>     String url=null;        url="http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub";   File app=new File("E:/CellTrust_Main/SecureLine_5.2.0CS.apk");   DesiredCapabilities capabilities=new DesiredCapabilities();   capabilities.setCapability("device", "Android");   capabilities.setCapability("app",app.getAbsolutePath());    capabilities.setCapability("deviceName","Android");        capabilities.setCapability("platformName", "Android");    capabilities.setCapability("platformVersion", "21");    capabilities.setCapability("app-package", "com.celltrust.securesms");    capabilities.setCapability("app-activity", "com.celltrust.secureline.pt.ui.controller.manager.Launcher");     driver= new RemoteWebDriver (new URL(url), capabilities);      driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(80, TimeUnit.SECONDS);    //Application launched   System.out.println(("Launched Application"));   System.out.println(driver.findElement(     By.xpath("//android.widget.Spinner <SEP> and about the zip file on github .is i need to  download  it <SEP> For creating androiddriver its showing some error.Hence could u share code <SEP> I wan swipe upside .bottom to top <SEP> and after ruby install what step i need to configure appium <SEP> Using int startx, int stary, int end x, int end y, int duration see the x and y coordinates in uiautometer view then give the values @Divya-tfw <SEP> HI, Can anyone please tell me how to generate HTML test report for python script? <SEP> hi , when i try to download ruby after some times it prompts following error <SEP> remote: Counting objects: 346796, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1399/1399), done. error: RPC failed; result=56, HTTP code = 2006 MiB | 91.00 KiB/s     fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly fatal: early EOF fatal: index-pack failed Failed during: git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/master -n <SEP> Can  any one tel how to fix this issue. <SEP> ! <SEP>  I wan exact code for swipe & scroll <SEP> Send screen shot for that page @Divya-tfw <SEP> I have drop down where I need to swipe down to select the city . <SEP> Will share screen shot <SEP> Drop dowm means use selectbyindex <SEP> @Divya-tfw <SEP> Share the screen shot to my mail nishanth.reddy0003@gmail.com <SEP> ok
<SEP> yeh it's just a GUI wrapper on top of Appium, which is why you can use it to attach onto existing appium server sessions to run your inspector <SEP> sort of like a Selenium IDE, but a very cut down version, still allows you to do basic record actions - better than nothing I guess <SEP> ya, i thought so :) just an opinion guys <SEP> Just want to hear your opinion -- <SEP> don't want to debate but I'm using Robot Framework (open source) + appium to manage automation scripts on mobile <SEP> Is there somekind listing of all "good" frameworks? <SEP> depends <SEP> ok, is there a list of possible frameworks? <SEP> no generic solution available.. since its very subjective question.. each app is different..so develop ur own.. instead of getting openion from people <SEP> - budget - which kind of application that you want to test - ect <SEP> there are some frameworks out there, Robot framework is an example, beside that, there are some more frameworks such as: cucumber <SEP> or you can even use TestNG / protractor / <SEP> I'm just trying to do presentation about test frameworks what you can use with appium <SEP> actually <SEP> Appium is designed in the theory: "independent programming language" <SEP> framework is just a set of rules that the man who use it should follow them <SEP> To be simple one should develop his own framework by using tools like appium <SEP> Handling the chrome browser in web application and in mobile are the both same, mean the same  ChromeDriver will it work ? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter I may be misinterpreting, but you'll have to use iOS/Android driver depending on the platform you want to test, then set your 'app' capability to the Chrome app on the device <SEP> hmm, under the hood, either web application or mobile web application will use selenium server to handle & execute event/action So the idea is they have the same 'core' even if you are performing the automation scripts on desktop browser/mobile browser But you know, the behavior in the mobile is always like is it on desktop browser! So you need to modify your scripts in order to make it works <SEP> @siggerzz , thanks for writing to me, u mean once we are able to launch the chrome, go to any website or search some thing rest of all are same as how we do with WebDriver ?? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter correct <SEP> its clear, Thanks to @minhnguyenphuonghoang  , @siggerzz <SEP> Usually in POM, we maintain the classes as per pages. in this if pages are more classes may be more, instead of this why can't we maintain the set of few classes in form of methods to cover all the functionalities of all the pages and call those methods from your tests, in this way we can reduce the number of classes and we can remember even the classes too since we have few, why we wont prefer this way ??? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter You got to think of people working on it in the future. It's easier to maintain if you have the methods for a specific page in a class dedicated to that page <SEP> @siggerzz , yes it may be crt but there is chance to have some common functionalities in more than one page assume with same id/name, in this case in POM we will write a function in all the pages to handle it, here we are missing the reuseability , is not it <SEP> You can use a 'BasePage' class <SEP> and have your pages inherit it <SEP> Then just declare all the common functionality in the BaseClass and call the method in the pages that need it
<SEP>  <SEP> Hey All,  I'm hoping to use PageObjects for IOS testing. But i keep running into issues with finding elements on the page.  Appium: 1.3.5 Java-Client 2.1.0  I have tried: 'code' '''   @iOSFindBy(className = "UIAButton")     private List <SEP> I have also posted my question above on the issues/Bug dicusss.appium.io. :) <SEP> Using the simulator. <SEP> I also see the pasted XML above in the debug window.
<SEP> Hi All, I am tring to install appium 1.3.6 version on Mac OSX 10.7.5 but It gives error at the time of lunching appium app. It shows error message that the appium version is supported 10.8 or higher but appium documentation tells appium supports Mac OSX 10.7 or higher. can somebody answer does it really support on Mac OSX 10.7.5? or  am i missing anything? <SEP> Instead of running Appium through the GUI I'm running it through bash now. I've also added different bootstrap ports per device. My automation seems more stable now - I'm hoping this fixes my issue :) <SEP> you can check for that though <SEP> Yes, in the todo list, with maybe node + child process. <SEP> I just want to confirm, parallel test execution across iOS devices requires 1 vm per additional iOS device, correct? (due to a dependency on Instruments I'm assuming) <SEP> yeah <SEP> instruments is the root cause of this <SEP> It seems like the 2014 Mac minis dropped support for quad core. Does anyone have any experience with running VMs with Appium on them? I'd imagine they'd be quite slow <SEP> @VidyasagarReddy459 you should avoid fruit strap unless you are trying  to deploy the app in CI setup. Are you using brew to setup the  "IOS-webkit-debug-Proxy"?. The instruction on  <SEP> Appium throwa bad App Error.
<SEP> :) <SEP> I realized appium inspector had two back buttons when i did show invisible <SEP> so I added a NavBarBackButton <SEP> and it's been problem free since <SEP> Nice... <SEP> one thing that's been useful as i've refactored <SEP> is I add accessibilityIds to the app itself <SEP> then do @iOSFindBy at the top of my page objects <SEP> I created a elementTable I use incase I wanna change a id in my app I just change it in one place in my automation <SEP> and then I made a method that just prints out all the elements and their information <SEP> like isDisplayed, tagName, getText, and toString() <SEP> ooooh an eleement table <SEP> best thing ever! <SEP> i guess mine is slightly similar <SEP> I just have 10+ pages <SEP> and all the Ids are at the top <SEP> making them private and then doing public actions for what can actually be done on each page <SEP> https://github.com/blueice349/Automation/blob/master/helpers/elements.js <SEP> so I just require the file in and call a element like this driver.elementById( elements.homeScreen.actions ).click() <SEP> be a little different sense you are using Java, im using JS <SEP> right right
<SEP> :) <SEP> @skbarora  am not into python <SEP> @skhanam - Do you know how to generate .app file out of code base? any reference will help. <SEP> @skhanam  Np thanks :) <SEP> am assuming u r on Xcode <SEP> are you ? <SEP> If you need an `.app` file, you can just unzip the `.ipa` and the `.app` is in the `Payload` directory

Create test data using automation script <SEP> 2. Run ur test scripts <SEP> *2 <SEP> ok.but my question is how to create that test data script? <SEP> just like u create ur test scripts.. simulate all steps to create your test data into java code.. <SEP> Hi element.click() is not working in Android device 4.4.2.

I used that to connect to one of my local devices over wifi.  With the way the AWS stuff works I'm not sure how I would actually find the host and port for the devices as they are running. They just take my appium scripts, run through it and then shut down <SEP> I go into the device farm, give it my APK, a zip with my python tests, choose devices and hit start and it does the tests on the devices <SEP> bummer <SEP> Yeah, I'm really stuck here. AWS has been no help either. If I had just SOMETHING to click those notifications I'd be able to add another 12 devices to the list of successful ones <SEP> I'll have to give the screen position click a try

<SEP> @Simon-Kaz you mentioned you can find coordinates using appium inspector if it's a native app, I'm using safarilauncher which launches safari, I was able to get the inspector to pop up and show me what's in screen so I think it should work in my case. I have no luck finding coordinates though <SEP> yeah i  wasnt aware you were using webview <SEP> you could take a screenshot of the device, it should be 100% of what the coordinates on the device are <SEP> the alternative are libs like sikuli, where you find the element using OCR <SEP> could use that for now to find the elements on different devices <SEP> I tried the screenshot technique, it looked promising but for whatever reason I can't get it to work. Additionally when I switch from native context back to web_view context appium throws an exception and the test can't continue (TypeError: Cannot read property 'disconnect' of null at ios-controller.js:1660:26) I'm wondering if appium doesn't support native methods when testing on a real iOS device using safari and ios_webkit_debug_proxy

<SEP> Im sure Ive missed something obvious; but is there an element identifier which is common to Android and iOS?   XPath seems out of the question between the two platforms.

"Simulator architecture appears to be unsupported by the '/Users/sreekanth/Desktop/iOS App/StreetReader.app' application. Make sure the correct deployment target has been selected for its compilation in Xcode." Xcode version: 9.1(beta) Mac OS: 10.13.4 (17E199) Appium version: 1.6.1 Thanks <SEP> Check with device name, did face the same issue using devices with same android version for automation <SEP> yeah passing proper device name and udid alongwith bootstrap port <SEP> try with each device separately  to narrow down the issue <SEP> working fine with only one device. tried with all the devices. if i run in only one device it goes smoothly :) <SEP> @sathya_nbg_twitter  Which version of iOS do you want to test? By the way, there is currently a 1.7.x and a 1.8.x release of appium supporting more and better iOS and Android versions <SEP> @wswebcreation I am trying to test iOS 9.3.5 and 11.1 <SEP> 1 sec, will check it for you, but there has been a change from apple from iOS 9 till 10 <SEP> where Appium needed to rewrite almost all code <SEP> @wswebcreation Thanks for the response, please let me know update on it. <SEP> which framework are you using?
<SEP> oO <SEP> this mak sense ? <SEP> Yes as the app I'm testing is using Unity and none of the elements are visible to the automation frameworks <SEP> @jjlehtinen even...soft keyboard? <SEP> I can find the keyboard element yes, the problem is that send_keys clicks on the center of the element, and in the keyboard element, the letter "g" is in the center of it <SEP> so as I have the textfield already focused, it will always input "G" before any of the text I want to enter <SEP> hmm, now for some reason G isn't being clicked anymore... <SEP>  How to test API in appium <SEP> Hey guys, I am wondering how you guys get alert messages on mobile devices? For example I would like to verify the error messages I get when I put wrong credentials for logging in to an app. I was trying ```browser.alertText()``` but Appium gives me an error like "Encountered internal error running command: Error: An attempt was made to operate on a modal dialog when one was not open." Any suggestions or examples will be much appreciated! <SEP> @quintuschen are you testing on mobile device or application? <SEP> Make sure you are on the right ```context``` to trigger right action <SEP> And running the tests again, G is being clicked again :) <SEP> Figured it out, seems like the latest appium-xcuitest-driver with the latest WDA works too well and when using send_keys it will click on the middle of the element first, if the element happens to be the soft keyboard, letter "G" will be clicked which will in practice mess up the input <SEP> when I installed the version of WDA that's bundled with the appium GUI app, and then run the latest appium-xcuitest-driver, seems like the click is somehow misaligned and doesn't land on any of the letters <SEP> possibly could add a check in `element.send_keys` that if the element type is `XCUIElementTypeKeyboard` we won't click in the middle of the element first <SEP>  Can anyone help me in how to test chat application with two devices <SEP> @TuHuynhVan thanks for replying, I am testing a mobile app. I did use browser.context() before using browser.alertText(), but Appium still gives me an error. <SEP> @quintuschen Pls switch the context <SEP> Thanks @TuHuynhVan could you give an example please? Im not sure how to switch, I thought webdriverios browser.context() is doing the job... but seems not working <SEP> @quintuschen  use ```browser.contexts();``` to get the context list then use ```browser.context( <SEP> Really thanks @TuHuynhVan it is very kind of you for helping me in multiple channels :smile: <SEP> yw, hopefully that can help <SEP> Hey @TuHuynhVan I tried your suggestion to switch context, I am able to switch context but when I tried to use browser.alertText() it tells me the method is not implemented:( <SEP> Sorry it actually say no alert open. : <SEP> @quintuschen I do not know why you thought that you just need to switch the context then use that method! <SEP> As I said, "Please switch to the correct context then use the correct action" <SEP> You can inspect the element then click on the OK button, I think. <SEP> So try again! <SEP> No it is a native app. I read the doc it says it only get text for JavaScript alert so I guess I cannot use that method to get alert messages <SEP> Yes! All I wanna say it waht you just said! <SEP> :smile: thanks Tu, I guess I will need to find another way to achieve that <SEP> I think you even do not need to switch context because that's a native app! <SEP> Yes, will do :)
<SEP> Good day people, I have a problem testing a hybrid app. While running my test on android driver.elementByCssSelector() <SEP> On android it returns the element. It is hidden so I check that with isDisplayed(). On IOS however, the same element raises an NoSuchElement error. When debugging the IOS emu the element clearly exists (same id's etc.) but is hidden. <SEP> Its running on ios 10.2 btw. <SEP> Hmm, it's due to an extra browser opening. Android stays in the same webview context while IOS switches... <SEP> @TMMeijers well its hidden <SEP> workaround here is get the parent element and get the children <SEP> by index <SEP> Nah appareantly iOS automatically switches webview contexts when it opens a new one as opposed to android <SEP> Would anybody have an idea on how to disable the automatic switching?

<SEP> it's ok <SEP> and I suggest u to mock this scenario. <SEP> u can discuss with developers how can they get a real device's location. there's must be a listener, waiting for requests come in. <SEP> just my idea, FYI <SEP> @rkba92 I Just checked. but we don't have custom method to get the device location in appium. <SEP> the only thing u need to do is to figure out a function, let it send request with a random time period. <SEP> @Amituowan_twitter @Rohithnm  Can u guys elaborate on your ideas? <SEP> Can u guys help me in achieving this, Thanks in advance. <SEP> @rkba92 I guess this link would help you out.  <SEP> HI All, I want scroll a list in Android app using python and following code is working for me: self.driver.find_element_by_android_uiautomator('new UiScrollable(new UiSelector().scrollable(true).instance(0)).scrollIntoView(new UiSelector().("India").instance(0));') <SEP> can anybody help me what is the use of appium tool? <SEP> which type of testing we do? <SEP> But this scrolls the list until it doesn't India, but i want to scroll only once. <SEP> Can anyone pls tell me how to scroll the list once? <SEP> @rkba92 -- Just a question, what is ROI of including GPS location including on Automation.. first thing it would be fast and more reliable if you rely on manual testing for such testing.. every tools have such limitations, you need to pick wisely and use its maximum capability. Testing like GPS, ImageVerifications are not good candidate for automation, that i believe

Just before sometime it was working with same configuration. Anyone has any idea about this? <SEP> @raj284 you are on wrong tab it seems from the screenshot. Choose Automatic server instead of custom server. Hope this helps :+1: <SEP> @wswebcreation Thanks, but My team helped already to figure it out.  As its difficult to find the correct xpath of element using latest Appium, the path used was partially correct. After choosing correct path test can choose child element now.  Correct: ${picker}               xpath=//* <SEP> @SamyQAZ  Thanks Bro.. This helped me :) <SEP> @raj284 hahaha. Thanks I know how it feel. Can relate to it. Bro, I am a girl :laughing: <SEP> Is there any tool to generate automation scripts from the test cases? <SEP> Does anyone know how to swipe delete for iOS native app. Seems swipe and swipe by percentage keywords from robot framework doesn't work. <SEP> ^^ <SEP> @SamyQAZ , which version of Appium are you on?  1.8.0 had a "breaking" change in the `moveTo`, went from relative to absolute <SEP> @wswebcreation I'm still using 1.7.2 <SEP> @SamyQAZ , ok, then that should not be a problem, have you checked the Appium log to see what commands are send? <SEP> @wswebcreation Yes I did, actually swipe works.  Seems dev aren't able to assign id to delete elements in table view. (swipe - delete appears) Tests pass-saying delete is performed, however element still appears on page. Which means somehow delete isn't clicked when test run.(using delete element name, as no accessibility_id present which fails) For time being using coordinates to perform delete action and it works like charm. <SEP> :thumbsup: <SEP> @wswebcreation  Have u tried to use robot framework? <SEP> nope, I'd like to work with "pure" frameworks <SEP> not with extra dependencies <SEP> I'm more a Javascript person, so I use webdriver.io and some other custom made libs to do the testing <SEP> ahhh yeah, seems robot framework is bit limiting. Also documentation isn't completely available <SEP> works like a charm and webdriver.io is, as far as I've seen and experienced, the best framework and it  has the best community <SEP> You are using it with mobile app, cross platform tests? <SEP> yep <SEP> its more for integration testing <SEP> ? <SEP> Hi guys, I am facing issue to scroll/swipe/click an element by coordinates using appium, python, robot framework. Is there a way to click an element / scroll page by screen size of the device like its done using python. Currently I have to write code for each device.   Looking for some generic solution like divide device screen size into half and scroll/ swipe/ click element. <SEP> Hi All is there a way to change Android device time with Appium? <SEP> Hi guys, Have some way to get screen identify by Appium? <SEP> @zcmgyu What you mean ? <SEP> I didn't try using that function. But if that screen has no title, something like Splash screen <SEP> May be u can try assertion  verifying any displayed content in that screen <SEP> driver.getPageSource();  did you try this <SEP> Yes, I've tried it. <SEP> what happened <SEP> It hasn't any related to screen identify.

<SEP> hi <SEP> @praveen1211 hi <SEP> is any work with appium with xamarian <SEP> sry xamarin <SEP> Am not <SEP> sorry <SEP> ok i need a way how to integrate appium with xamarin <SEP> @praveen1211 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaJA59vxBDS7smS81Gqf7KA/videos <SEP> go with this youtube channel and u can got any answer about apium and its working prioniciple <SEP> let me check once tq for link <SEP> @praveen1211 :+1: <SEP> i have knowledge on appium with java <SEP> @praveen1211  you can ask him @mgmanikandan87 <SEP> ok let me ping to him <SEP> :thumbsup:  @praveen1211 <SEP> @friendlyspeak_twitter  thank you man <SEP> @praveen1211 love to help :bow: <SEP> @friendlyspeak_twitter  thats great to hear that word form you <SEP> @praveen1211 :pray: <SEP>  Hey guys,  I need to implement some complex touch action, like press, move, hold, release. It works, but I need add a second waitAction after move gesture to hold a bit. And it seems appium is ignoring second waitAction. The gesture doesn't wait and even work at all.  Any idea how to get it working? <SEP> @aozolin  you can check this site may be its useful <SEP> https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/touch-actions/ <SEP> @praveen1211  thanks, but doesn't. It's just a common description, and I know how to use it. But the issue is it doesn't work in my specific complex gesture <SEP> ok @aozolin <SEP> @aozolin maybe if you gave more specifics people would be able to help. <SEP> @Kyle-Gray yes, sure So I need to implement following gesture Press and hold on some element, move it on some another element, wait few seconds while some menu will pop up and release. I'm using appium java client , and server, both the latest version. Here is my code:  ```touchAction.longPress(longPressOptions).moveTo(pointOptionB).waitAction(new WaitOptions().withDuration(Duration.ofSeconds(2))).release().perform();``` <SEP> Instead of `longPress` can you try `press`? <SEP> did you check out appium samples?  https://github.com/appium/sample-code/blob/master/sample-code/examples/java/junit/src/test/java/com/saucelabs/appium/GestureTest.java
<SEP> yes i even tried with different element same result. Also I used the appium inspector to find it in the hierarchy and I can see it visible too. <SEP> the only difference is that this is the next activity after splash on Android manifest. I initiate first without giving specific activity,but not sure if I have to specify the next one in following tests. <SEP> If it is there but not clickable, but you can click on it by hand, the you can do something like this with WebdriverIO  ```js     // simple touch action using selector and x y variables     // tap location is 1px right and 1px down relative from the center of the element     $(selector).touchAction({         action: 'tap', x: 1, y:1     }) ```

My swipe is 370, 145, 5, 145, 550.  I tried changing the duration to longer (900, 1000) but it doesn't seem to matter. <SEP> btw I'm on iOS 8.4 simulator <SEP> @Henrak  we cant automate the app which is downloaded from app store.

<SEP> Hi <SEP> I need  a help to setup appium for iOS hybrid app <SEP> Please help me out <SEP> You need to switch driver in code in hybrid apps. You may just google a solution <SEP> Hi everyone. I'm using webdriverio with appium to test a react native app on iOS and Android. I'm having an issue where using `setValue` on a text field will sometimes skip certain letters. My guess is that the input is sent too quickly such that some characters are lost. I've tried fiddling with a work around using `setInterval` and async/await, but I can't seem to get it to send just individual letters (`addValue` seems to just concatenate and then use `setValue` under the hood, so it has the same issue). I wonder if there is a better solution? <SEP> Hah. As always just after asking a question you find a solution yourself. `setValue` seems to work differently between iOS and Android. On iOS it appends to the input, whereas on Android it clears the input and then adds the values. Anyway this works for me on iOS: `for (let c of text) { $("~input-field").setValue(c); driver.pause(100) }`. <SEP> I believe I've only seen missing characters on iOS so I think my solution will be to make a platform conditional on text field inputs, adding a loop with `driver.sleep()` on iOS. Thanks for listening everyone. :D <SEP> Hm actually `driver.pause()` doesn't seem to be needed at all. The loop adds enough of a delay by itself. If anyone's curious I'm using `npm i -g appium@beta` and `"@wdio/appium-service": "6.10.11"`. <SEP> @Federic81346665_twitter After performing horizontal swipe i am getting no such element exception <SEP> Hi, does anyone use Appium for tvOS automation? <SEP> Hi team <SEP> I am facing one issue while switching to iframe from different domain due to the same origin policy ? <SEP> I am working on safari browser in ios devices ? <SEP> ! <SEP> Hi, can anyone help me on this. i m facing WebDriver Exception while executing my appium scripts, please find the logs. <SEP> @Anitha07171322_twitter  check whether device is connected properly..check using adb command <SEP> Hello Together,  noReset desired capability is not working with iOS in version 1.19.1  Any one has tried this desired capability, could you please help me here

<SEP> hi to all, what about UI Testing from XCode 7 in appium? who knows? <SEP> Hi everybody, I am figuring out testing Intern NodeJS tests on mobile real devices. I just noticed a issue where with Android, Appium uses the ADB tool to determine which device I want to use, based on the ID. With iOS that's a different story, where I need to start everytime a different ios_webkit_debug_proxy and giving it the correct UUID. Is there something out there, that either makes it possible to make Appium do all the ios_webkit_debug_proxy themself, or a hub in front of it or something, that I only need to give appium the correct UUID in the capabilities, so I won't need to start everytime a new ios_webkit_debug_proxy for each device I want the test to run on ? <SEP> Basically, I want to start a test on a external machine (in the same network), and that appium does the testing on the device I specify it to in the test, without having first to start the ios_webkit_debug_proxy on the correct device beforehand. I want Appium to do this for me, just like it does with adb. <SEP> native apps dont require debug proxy <SEP> Basically, it only makes a screenshot right now using intern with nodejs. Thing is, we want it tested on multiple devices, testing serially, using a ID to connect to the proper device each test, making screenshots of various pages. <SEP> Yes, but we do not want to change that on the Appium side of the machine. If we send a test via intern with NodeJS to the appium server, Appium should be handling this, without any work before hand to link up a ios-webkit-debugger to the iOS device. So basically, when Appium gets a request to test something on a iOS device, it should link up to the specified device by running for example ios-webkit-debug-proxy to the specified device with the correct port, and start testing it. <SEP> As I noticed, Appium starts ADB and checks if the device is connected, and makes a connection to the android device on the ID that is given via intern.

On Android its working perfectly. I calculate the pixel per second i have to drop for the value i want to set. Then i grab the thumbs with TouchAction and slide it. On iOS i am not able to get the drag and drop for the thumb. The viewport of my driver.Window().Size is exactly the half of the pixels (iPhone Xr 1,792x828).  So which coordinates i have to drag and drop? The driver pixel or the real pixel? In both cases i am not able to set the slider.  Driver Slider coordinates: x~22, y=643 Real Slider Coordinates: x~45, y=1418 ``` var slider = driver.FindElementByAccessibilityId("Slider");             var PixelPerSecond = slider.Size.Width / GetSongDuration();              var y = slider.Location.Y;             var xLeft = slider.Location.X;             var xRight = slider.Location.X + slider.Size.Width;              foreach (var i in Enumerable.Range(0, 4))             {                 var lowerDiff = lower - GetLoopStartPosition();                 if (lowerDiff != 0)                 {                     var pixelToDragFromLeft = PixelPerSecond * lowerDiff;                      TouchAction action = new TouchAction(driver);                     action.Touch(xLeft, y);                     action.MoveTo(xLeft + Convert.ToInt32(pixelToDragFromLeft), y);                     action.Release();                     action.Perform();                                         xLeft += Convert.ToInt32(pixelToDragFromLeft);                 }                 else                 {                     break;                 }             } ```  The other problem is, that i have Time Picker (Xamarin Syncfusion SfPicker). On iOS i see the two Picker Wheels as UI elements in the visual tree. On Android i cant see them, the visual tree is basically empty although my UI elements have a AutomationId. How can interact with the hidden elements?

Open installed X-code in your  mac machine , then connect the cable to real device. Now Go to Setting  <SEP> Yea true .but we are not finding any developer option on mobile <SEP> @Divya-tfw  trust the ios device by visiting itunes in settings..dev options gets enabled <SEP> Hi all, Appium is a great tool and I have been testing apps using it on Android. I am new to it but the great features of it is really making my tests easier. However, is it possible for me to set up Appium like the 2 ways below:  Is it possible to config the adb path as a custom path, instead of using the default path of Android_Home environment variable?  Is it possible to config the adb file name from adb.exe into something like xxx_adb.exe?  The reason I ask is because for some simulators they get their own adb with different file path and even custom adb names. <SEP> Is there any option i can run test on the devices connected remotely ?
<SEP> @SentientRobot_twitter can you provide a screenshot? <SEP> autoAcceptAlerts and autoDismissAlerts don't get rid of it, I have no way to reproduce locally so I'm struggling with how I would hit the OK there <SEP> try to find the element by text? <SEP> what is the syntax for that?

It just takes forever to do one off tests on the AWS device farm <SEP> "Message: The requested resource could not be found, or a request was received using an HTTP method that is not supported by the mapped resource." <SEP> when I do the uiautomator approach <SEP> @SentientRobot_twitter can you try using `unicodeKeyboard: true` capabilities for that specific device and see whether you are getting that pop up ? <SEP> `unicodeKeyboard: true` is just one of the desired capabilities. You just need to mention it in your desired capabilities block <SEP> fuck!!! <SEP> @AB09 that may not work then. I believe AWS only pays attention to a few desired capabilities but I will give it a shot anyways. There are other system messages that pop up in other devices so it would be good to find something that does click the ok or cancel on them
<SEP> https://mobileautotools.wordpress.com/appium-setup-for-ios-10/ <SEP> @sudhagetsin_twitter  you cant automate without debug and singed certificate <SEP> You can tweak in WebDriverAgent project to accept signing certificates.

<SEP> @KumarShailav_twitter Hi you can flow the same strategy like we do for appium Mac OSX. <SEP> @kavalerchik Can you just add all appium related dependencies in your pom. xml and start with appium directly. You really don't need to have a new IDE if you are already using Eclipse or IntelliJ. If you are doing for android then you can create a app folder in project directory and paste your android .apk file . Coming to your CI integration with Jenkins you can do for appium as well. It will be few more additional steps: 1. You need to write few scripts to start your appium server there 2. Secondly, You need to create emulator and launch it. 3. At last you can trigger your maven project by adding Maven step. <SEP> Anyone here using swipe or has interacted with sliders in Appium 1.8.1, This is for Android. <SEP> @kavalerchik  Oh, I thought you are testing mobile apps. For testing web apps you really don't need to have apk and other stuffs. <SEP> @MaxFix Hey this means there is an issue with the package name and app launch activity you have mentioned in your capabilities. Please check your app package name and also the activity you are using to launch. If you are facing frequently then get it checked with your dev team <SEP> @kavalerchik Yes correct <SEP>  Hi Guys, Anyone tried any automation for OCR related tests?(Scan a credit card and see the values on the form in the app) heard that it can be automated using an image from gallery... not really sure <SEP> ! <SEP> Guys, Using C# and iOS native app Have a scenario where I click on an element in IOS native app and it opens up the browser,  Assert something on browser and  I need to return back to the app and do stuff... Anyone did anything similar before?need code sample on how you achieved it.

I have managed to get logs via the selenium web driver using driver.manage().logs().get('logcat') but the come in one massive lump and don't update during the test. I know its not usually good practice to use the logs in a test because they are hard to control but our app controls complex IOT devices and log messages are the best way to verify these processes in place. Has anyone implemented live log reading for either platform ? I can do it locally but Appium seems to truncate logcat and that wouldn't work with the grid setup <SEP>  I'm getting the following error when appium is running. appium-doctor says everything is set up correctly and when i do 'adb devices' it works fine.

Just before sometime it was working with same configuration. Anyone has any idea about this? <SEP> @raj284 you are on wrong tab it seems from the screenshot. Choose Automatic server instead of custom server. Hope this helps :+1: <SEP> @wswebcreation Thanks, but My team helped already to figure it out.  As its difficult to find the correct xpath of element using latest Appium, the path used was partially correct. After choosing correct path test can choose child element now.  Correct: ${picker}               xpath=//* <SEP> @SamyQAZ  Thanks Bro.. This helped me :) <SEP> @raj284 hahaha. Thanks I know how it feel. Can relate to it. Bro, I am a girl :laughing: <SEP> Is there any tool to generate automation scripts from the test cases? <SEP> Does anyone know how to swipe delete for iOS native app. Seems swipe and swipe by percentage keywords from robot framework doesn't work. <SEP> ^^ <SEP> @SamyQAZ , which version of Appium are you on?  1.8.0 had a "breaking" change in the `moveTo`, went from relative to absolute <SEP> @wswebcreation I'm still using 1.7.2 <SEP> @SamyQAZ , ok, then that should not be a problem, have you checked the Appium log to see what commands are send? <SEP> @wswebcreation Yes I did, actually swipe works.  Seems dev aren't able to assign id to delete elements in table view. (swipe - delete appears) Tests pass-saying delete is performed, however element still appears on page. Which means somehow delete isn't clicked when test run.(using delete element name, as no accessibility_id present which fails) For time being using coordinates to perform delete action and it works like charm. <SEP> :thumbsup: <SEP> @wswebcreation  Have u tried to use robot framework? <SEP> nope, I'd like to work with "pure" frameworks <SEP> not with extra dependencies <SEP> I'm more a Javascript person, so I use webdriver.io and some other custom made libs to do the testing <SEP> ahhh yeah, seems robot framework is bit limiting. Also documentation isn't completely available <SEP> works like a charm and webdriver.io is, as far as I've seen and experienced, the best framework and it  has the best community <SEP> You are using it with mobile app, cross platform tests? <SEP> yep <SEP> its more for integration testing <SEP> ? <SEP> Hi guys, I am facing issue to scroll/swipe/click an element by coordinates using appium, python, robot framework. Is there a way to click an element / scroll page by screen size of the device like its done using python. Currently I have to write code for each device.   Looking for some generic solution like divide device screen size into half and scroll/ swipe/ click element. <SEP> Hi All is there a way to change Android device time with Appium? <SEP> Hi guys, Have some way to get screen identify by Appium? <SEP> @zcmgyu What you mean ? <SEP> I didn't try using that function. But if that screen has no title, something like Splash screen <SEP> May be u can try assertion  verifying any displayed content in that screen <SEP> driver.getPageSource();  did you try this <SEP> Yes, I've tried it. <SEP> what happened <SEP> It hasn't any related to screen identify.
<SEP> What is Mocha? <SEP> mocha is what I use to run the test in appoium <SEP> appium <SEP> Is it a plugin for javascript? <SEP> No you need to install it just like you would appium let me get you a sample test to follow using mocha
<SEP> https://www.browserstack.com/automate/physical-mobile-devices <SEP> Cool <SEP> https://www.browserstack.com/support?tag=automate <SEP> so I was looking at an example that uses appium and browserstack <SEP> I'll try to figure it out myself if no one knows an example for this <SEP> (currently I'm using cucumber js, webdriverio and browserstack for my tests suit set up) <SEP> @amalv It'll be the same as using appium locally, however you'll need to provide the capabilities described on the URL you pasted.  You'll also need to make sure to point your appium driver to browserstack, although as I don't use browserstack, I'm not sure what that'll be :P <SEP> something like this I suppose:
<SEP> http://appium.io/docs/en/commands/context/set-context/ <SEP> check to see if you can find the solution here <SEP>  I have not handled context to connect from webview <SEP> How did you connect to the webview <SEP> Can you tell me the procedure you have followed to automate the webview <SEP> @iSravyaS  I have not handled webview, from the mobile. Only apk, without web view management. But with what I've read you have to connect with chromedrive, which is the one that allows hybrid automation to put it that way. <SEP> Maybe you have some idea to resolve this ?

<SEP> Hello, I am seeing really weird behavior trying to test my iOS 8 app with the ruby appium_lib. <SEP> I have lots of similar tests that work so I don't think it's my test code. <SEP> The issue is that I have a table view with three cells and i can find all three cells <SEP> and I can click on and interact with the first two <SEP> but the last cell becomes disabled as soon as I try to interact with it <SEP> cell.enabled? is true <SEP> but if i try to do cell.click <SEP> I get  `post /element/13/click Selenium::WebDriver::Error::UnknownError: elementId 13 could not be tapped` <SEP> then when i check cell.enabled? it says false <SEP> in arc if i do it manually it works <SEP> but when I run my tests it fails in the manner I described above. <SEP> I have dumped the page_source from both arc and from a binding.pry session within my test at the exact place where I get the error and the two source are identical using diff <SEP> Has anybody seen this behavior? <SEP> Or have any clue what could cause this? <SEP> Yeah, it's really frustrating, because everything else just works <SEP> and it's a very simple test <SEP> nothing fancy <SEP> @sebv will try that <SEP> for what it's worth we are using Appium 1.3, *not beta* and running on iOS simulator <SEP> Put your log in a gist. <SEP> Ok , will do.

Has anyone have sample if using getPerformanceDataTest() in Appium for collecting metrics of Android devices? <SEP> Hey has anyone setup a Java Appium Cucumber suite? <SEP> Been trying to find a good guide or instructions on how to setup one. <SEP> hell friends, General Appium question. In general what are the available industry standard open source reporting frameworks or tools that gel with Appium. To elaborate, i have written a mobile automated Java Appium Testcase with TESTNG. This is working fine but the reporting of results looks little primitive. Are there any other framework or tool that will work with Appium java test client to give a client facing reporting? <SEP> hey @mailsathere you have several fairly solid options with Java <SEP> Mine favourite is with serenity-bdd, however that's a full fledged automation framework that integrates with several test frameworks such as cucumber/junit/picocontainer/selenium/restapi libraries etc. <SEP> try allure-reports, there should be a plugin already for using it with cucumber or testng for java, which will automatically log all the events thrown from either cucumber or testng into a nice looking html report <SEP> if you want something more standalone and far more customizable, have a look at ExtentReports - there should also be a listener available for this library as well. Else you can just call the extentreport api to log whatever you want in your hooks
<SEP> Hi guys, thanks for all the support. I raised https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/5556 about 18 days ago. Could I get a response on it? Thanks. <SEP> @savishy If the gallery its your own gallery you can ask devs to attribute content-desc to elements inside it and try to make those visible. If uiautomatorviewer tool cannot access anything beyond that point, appium wont either <SEP> @tfcardoso Alright, I think I was going in that direction as well. I have access to the source (but little knowledge of android development). Do you know if one can add `content-desc` to say, individual images in a gallery view? If so, any tips on where I can find docs on doing that? <SEP> @savishy No idea. Actually never developed for android :) <SEP> @tfcardoso never mind, thanks a lot for responding! I will work with devs, and if I get a solution that works I'll update issue 5556 so it helps others. <SEP> How to uninstall appium 1.4.11 which has been installed through npm?

Any help on this would be greatly appreciated as i am blocked without. Please make me look good to my bosses ;) <SEP> react native no need any extention , you can use uiautomator itself <SEP> getting the ids, texts and other propertie <SEP> sorry i dont mean an extension for react, i meant an extension for appium. presently the locator options on Android are: resource ids, content descriptions, and view tags. Appium supports the first two. The code in the link i posted is supposed to allow the third, but i dont know how to implement / use it. <SEP> i think both methods are depricated or removed (not sure) in ew java-cleint <SEP> better to use touchActions <SEP> ok thanks guys.. <SEP> thanks @priyankshah217 <SEP> I have one more query about identifying object using Appium <SEP> here is scenario:  I have page with different sections like appointments, contacts, insurance and some other objects, Here I can see xml source in appium for all the objects (contacts, insurance, etc) apart from appointments...

<SEP> Hello <SEP> Can we run automation scripts with signed APK <SEP> because I have tried on signed apk my all test scripts got failed <SEP> but on debug its running fine <SEP> Is `UiAutomator` installed on phone or it comes with `AndroidSDK`? <SEP> Hi , is it mandatory to use appium studio in future ? <SEP> how much stable is the free version of appium studio ? <SEP> Hi, does anyone know if it is possible to configure appium to use a different, new simulator for every e2e test file? Best case would be multiple simulators parallel (maybe with a max number of simulators), but sequentially would be fine. <SEP> @mahnuh Possibly yes. You could write a testng test (or similar) which run in parallel and invoke different simulator every time. You might need to start different appium server for every test. Note that this would increase execution time a lot. <SEP> @Asimk21 Ok. Is it possible to kill and restart the simulator after every test? <SEP> Yes, you can try and reset simulator/device using capability `reset=true` <SEP> actually its `noReset=false` <SEP> https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/writing-running-appium/caps.md <SEP> No u dont need to start different appium server <SEP> start single server and multiple client requests can be handled <SEP> @saikrishna321 Is it using different capabilities in each test? <SEP> and possibly `--session-override` ?? <SEP> no dont override the sessions <SEP> https://github.com/appium/appium/blob/master/docs/en/advanced-concepts/parallel-tests.md#parallel-android-tests <SEP> check this <SEP> Cool. Thanks!! <SEP> @Asimk21 Thanks, I already tried noReset. The thing is, I am looking for specs with this in my config: specs:  <SEP> @mahnuh Then I guess you need to kill/close simulator every time AfterTest and start simulator in BeforeTest. <SEP> @Asimk21 Okay, thanks! <SEP> Hi all, there was a problem, the appium does not exist given xpath: //android.widget.LinearLayout <SEP> Hi All,Am doing mobile automation for IOS app using appium desktop..am not able to automate select picker wheel option where we can select a value from dropdown.Any help/suggestions would be much appreciated.Thanks. <SEP> How can I interact with alert in iOS?

How to launch appium UI from "usr/local/lib/node_modules"? <SEP> `usr/local/lib/node_modules` is just the directory appium get installed to when you run `npm install -g appium` <SEP> Okay you want me to delete appium folder in node_modules and re-install it again <SEP> info AppiumDoctor Appium Doctor v.1.4.3 info AppiumDoctor ### Diagnostic starting ### info AppiumDoctor   <SEP> I think required dependencies are installed for iOS <SEP> But for iOS why do i require android SDK? <SEP> which i imagine relies on android dependencies <SEP> currently appium installs both android/ios dependencies by default, regardless of whether you only plan on testing ios/android <SEP> I think I remember reading that they're going to change that soon, so you can specify the platforms you're testing on, and it'll only download the required dependencies, but that isn't in place yet :( <SEP> Okay Let me install Android SDK and I will get back to you if I am getting any issue. Thank you @siggerzz
<SEP> Does anyone know how to take screenshots on a failed test? I am using node to write the tests.

I'm desperately searching for the iOS solution <SEP> @iSravyaS  We are also facing the same issue, if you get to know please post to us also <SEP> Hi All, Can someone please let me know if Appium can be used to automate TC75 Zebra devices. <SEP> @iSravyaS  If this debugging enabled : WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled as true, then no need to use driver.context instead of that directly access the elements. We have successfully completed automating. <SEP>  @nadimsayyed84 <SEP> driver.executeScript("mobile:Scroll","element") <SEP> You want to scroll or swipe? <SEP> I want to validate button color but color attribute does not exist in DOM. <SEP> Please help me how to validate color in Appium IOS test automation <SEP> Any one automated hybrid app <SEP> @MSivaranjani  i want to scroll on ios and android both. <SEP> @nadimsayyed84 the above solution will work for ios ..I will check android and let you know <SEP> @arun68154859_twitter Yes <SEP> @MSivaranjani <SEP> For me there is no element while inspecting using uiautomator <SEP> Only class name is there <SEP> But all class name is same <SEP> What will do in this case <SEP> @arun68154859_twitter  what kind of hybrid app it is <SEP> native + webview <SEP> or same for ios and android <SEP> Web view <SEP> Native+ web <SEP> Ionic <SEP> @MSivaranjani <SEP> ? <SEP> Hi guys, anybody faced issue while starting an activity with espresso driver ? `Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to resolve activity for: Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN flg=0x14000000 cmp=com.abc.xyz/.com.efg.pax.newface.presentation.newface.NewFace } at  <SEP> Suddenly my real ios devices starts to run all tests multiple times. Using appium 1.13-beta3 and Selenium 3.141.59. After like three or four runs they report correctly. But its lots of time wasted. Any ideas what might be causing this? <SEP> @flexin777 The issue looks with the desired capabilities... Change the platform version to 7.1 instead of 7.1.1 and also just verify the capabilities once.
<SEP> Hi all, I have a situation, can find an element if I scroll down, so I am using list <SEP> @Edge-Man thanks! I'll take a look. <SEP> @Edge-Man you can use explicit wait for the element that you are getting StaleElementRefException,  this exception comes when you perform some action, and you want to act on another element but that time DOM refreshes, so we can put an explicit wait before acting on that another element...
<SEP> Hi All, Do any know how to overcome this webdriver agent connection timeout while execution?? <SEP> can you post the log? <SEP> Hi guys. Is there any performance stats logger for appium both iOS/Appiium? Let's say, looking t how much memory the app is using on the phone. etc?

Does anybody have a complete example code on how to run 1 test case against multiple devices? I can't seem to figure out a reasonable way how to handle multiple instances of webdriver.
<SEP> Hi, how to wait elements like (JAVA)"wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.name("somename")));" in Node.js <SEP> I have a bit of a newbie question if someone might be open to answering it. <SEP> I'm trying to do a basic content verification in Ruby (via text('something')). When this isn't found, how do I ensure a failure is reported instead of the NoSuchElementError? <SEP> you should be asserting that the element exists before you try and interact with it <SEP> Thanks Simon - I was just reviewing something that indicated that exact issue <SEP> Seems like I should do text_exact <SEP> i personally assert on string contains <SEP> text_exact matches whitespace etc so its a bit hard <SEP> Hm. I think I must not get the concept. I can try string contains as well, but even with text_exact, the output is a No Element Found timeout error versus a failure <SEP> thats because youre trying to get text from an element that doesnt exist <SEP> which is an issue before checking the text <SEP> But if I'm expecting it to? <SEP> something went wrong earlier <SEP> and the element is not there <SEP> it could be because the element will eventually show up <SEP> in which case you could wait for the visibility of the element for X seconds <SEP> @Simon-Kaz So if I'm expecting some specific text on a page and it isn't found, how do I assert that as a failure? <SEP> you should take a step back and assert the existence of the element first <SEP> I guess that's what I'm asking how to do. I'm having trouble finding the right documentation for what I seem to be missing <SEP> what language are you using? <SEP> i assume you have the selector for the element that youre trying to get the text from <SEP> you can wrap that in a wait <SEP> i assume that the element eventually appears <SEP> Of everything shown to me in the Appium inspector, I can't discern what the appropriate attribute would be

<SEP> Can Appium do image recognition. Comparing read and unread messages state from change in colour? <SEP> Did anyone tried something like this? <SEP> @SamyQAZ , no it can't you need to use an external library to do the comparison. Appium can only provide the screenshots for that <SEP> @wswebcreation Is it possible to get page source and compare it? <SEP> only on UI hierarchy <SEP> not visual <SEP> also I am not sure how to compare source prior message is unread and wait almost 10-15 minutes to capture its read status. <SEP> What do you exactly mean <SEP> @wswebcreation I mean Appium can wait for 60 sec prior running other commands in the test. My app require to wait for 15 minutes to receive message. Even if I capture source I am not sure how with Appium I can compare sources and share relevant results when test ends. <SEP> Hi guys, Did anyone used third party merchants like sauce labs, xMarian and test cloud.

<SEP> i don't think appium is for non technical folks <SEP> you can definitely use cucumber with appium <SEP> most pain is in setup <SEP> if the non-technical folks are not writing actual tests fine <SEP> but to write selectors and stuff you do need some knowledge <SEP> i trained an intern at work and she got going in a month or 2 on her own, its always about ROI <SEP> As long as they can run the tests on their machines and potentially use the appium app to do one off tests then I'd be fine with that.

<SEP> Hello Team, Currently I m facing an error with ios webkit debug proxy. Can someone help me resolving this? Issue: <SEP> WebKit debugger got a message for 'Console.enable' and have no handler, doing nothing.  <SEP> I just finished automating the Amazon Fire Stick. Should probably be the same for the Fire TV. Does anyone have experience with Roku or Apple TV with Appium? <SEP> I am in trouble because Appium can not be used.  1. Start up Appium. 2. Press Start Server v1.8.1 button. 3. Select New Session Window. 4. Select Automatic Server. 5. Set up Disabled Capabilities. 6. Press the Start Session button.  The following error message is displayed  "The server refuse to browse the page. The URL or other input may not be correct. Please confirm the value.  URL: http: // localhost: 4723 / wd / hub / session ERROR: CONNECT (localhost: 4723) / connect: Connection refused "  When you run appium-doctor -ios you will see "Everything looks good, bye!" so I think Appium settings are done.  Why does the above error appear when I press the Start Session button?  A similar error message is displayed whether you connect iphone to Mac or not. <SEP> how to click an element in mobile using appium code? <SEP>  I am using Nodejs with Appium on a native iOS app.  Im currently trying to setup my tests to enable some console reporting and assertions. I wasnt sure on the best frameworks to use for this, so I have been trialling different ones. Im currently trying to get Mocha/Chai working and have also even tried some chai-as-promised.  My main issue is that as soon as I run the test using npm run ios (a shortcut from my package.json), my tests instantly pass, even though my simulator hasnt even yet loaded the app up. If I have an assertion in there, then it instantly fails as it states the result is pending. Ive tried playing around with different forms of assertions and expect statements and also moving them to different places (as well as adding a beforeEach)  Here is my code:  const wdio = require('webdriverio'); const caps = {"platformName":"iOS","platformVersion":"11.4","deviceName":"iPhone 8","app":"/Users/xxx.app","automationName":"XCUITest"}; const driver = wdio.remote({   protocol: "http",   host: "localhost",   port: 4723,   path: "/wd/hub",   desiredCapabilities: caps });  var expect = require('chai').expect; //var assert = require('chai').assert;  var chai = require('chai'); var chaiAsPromised = require('chai-as-promised'); chai.Should(); chai.use(chaiAsPromised); chaiAsPromised.transferPromiseness = driver.transferPromiseness;  describe("Onboarding Login Test Desc", function () {  it("Onboarding Login Test It", function(){ driver.init()   .waitForVisible("~btn_onboarding_right_action")   .pause(1000)   .touchAction( <SEP> @simongilmurray  Don't use the standalone version, but the testrunner, by the way, this looks like a promise thingy <SEP> @wswebcreation sorry what do you mean by the testrunner?

I've tried implementing expects, adding "done();" to the it statements as per someone's suggestion, but everytime I run the test , it immediately prints out that the tests have passed even before they have run (they then continue to run as expected). I'm not sure if this is some async issue, I have also tried utilising promises but not had any luck. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If do we have any solution for that I will test which keyboard  present and will write Assert for Numeric one...If it is also not possible I will skip this. What do you suggest bro ? <SEP> to check which keyboard is pop up for the text field, I don't have any solution for now. You can search it on google to find out how you do it!

<SEP> i don't think appium is for non technical folks <SEP> you can definitely use cucumber with appium <SEP> most pain is in setup <SEP> if the non-technical folks are not writing actual tests fine <SEP> but to write selectors and stuff you do need some knowledge <SEP> i trained an intern at work and she got going in a month or 2 on her own, its always about ROI <SEP> As long as they can run the tests on their machines and potentially use the appium app to do one off tests then I'd be fine with that.  I can create the tests and such myself. <SEP> that should be doable <SEP> just use cucumber and appium <SEP>  I saw a bunch of sites with cucumber appium.  Which one would you recommend? <SEP> not sure what you mean, do you have experience in setting up cucumber yourself? <SEP> Yup <SEP> yeah <SEP> then that's it <SEP> you write your tests/features in cucumber <SEP> and your driver is appium <SEP> same as selenium <SEP> don't know what sites you are refering <SEP> appium does not have very good documentation, but a very active community so good luck <SEP> Meaning that there are a bunch of different flavors of cucumber appium that people have built off of <SEP> i don't know about it <SEP> Honestly, appiums Docs are the reason I had a hard time getting to the point of considering it.  However, it's good to know about the active community <SEP> and wouldn't recommend personally <SEP> i am all about owning my own fate <SEP> Fair enough!  haha <SEP> cucumber in itself is a good bdd framework <SEP> and appium is the driver <SEP> you shouldn't need anything else <SEP> oh yeah, I use it now with Calabash <SEP> i am not a fan of calabash, capybara, etc <SEP> Sadly though the Calabash team makes updates that break everything <SEP> just because i am not the owner of my destiny then and never like getting stuck with these open source projects <SEP> exactly, if appium does you are in the pool with thousands of us <SEP> and they will do a dot release asap <SEP> That is exactly what I need <SEP> All good info!  thanks!
<SEP> *experienced <SEP> Also, take a look at: https://www.browserstack.com/app-automate/get-started#configuring-capabilities <SEP> ah no problem, I think I'm starting to get it <SEP> in my case I don't want to test a native app, I only want have access to the native components of the device (take a picture in this case), so I'm not sure if appium extends the API methods I have access with my current webdriverio setup configuration, but I hope it works like that :+1:

<SEP> do we have any active chat group specific to selenium <SEP> or is this group would be fine to post selenium queries ?? <SEP> Anyone have an idea as to why I'm unable to find elements inside an IFrame on iOS?

That has detailed information including step by step instructions. In case of specific question you can post <SEP> Do you have any idea if we launch app using appium inspector? <SEP> Because in my case app gets start but after splash screen automatically closed. <SEP> XCUITest <SEP> getting this error log. <SEP> @thephilwells It's still failing for me too. Also, `setContext` apparently is not the correct method, and it's `switchContext`. lol, docs <SEP> for the `appium-xcuitest-driver`, what is the correct method to set my context to webview from NATIVE_APP? I've tried `setContext()` and `switchContext()` and `context()` and none of them actually set the context. <SEP> `getContexts()` returns the contexts as expected
<SEP> ? <SEP> Mac Yosmite+Appium 1.5.3+iOS 9 or below <SEP> this was the environment i was using earlier <SEP> Our dev team still not upgraded to latest xcode or XCUITest <SEP> hi can any one help on below issue, i have a search box to enter text, but while spying with uiautomator unable to get that text box properties to identify, had any one faced this type of issue <SEP> for example flipkart search text box <SEP> for that also through uiautomator not gettign any properties. so how to hanlde this type of objects <SEP> @shabinmohan  Yes I have tried 1.5.3 version for appium but i am facing issues.As i have mentioned above

<SEP> Any pointers on handling Android permissions/ popup from Protractor would be really helpful please <SEP> @raj8github I don't think appium can handle permissions (atleast I haven't tried). If you mean permission pop ups in android then you can try `adb  shell input keyevent` to accept or reject the permissions. <SEP> Sure thank you.. Let me try that

Entire sections are missing and the screenshots look nothing like the current version of the app <SEP> appium 1.4.0 : Android : "fix for scrollTo", does someone know what is the fix? <SEP> would be nice to have github issues linked on release page <SEP> long press gesture failed in appium 1.4.0 <SEP> and worked in 1.3.7 with same java client 2.2.0 <SEP> Hi All, Does anyone know "how to start and stop the appium server programatically using java?" <SEP> Does anyone know how to get iOS absolute coordinates based on user touch? I'm trying to automate clicking something on a canvas and unfortunately I need to use hard coded coordinates to do this. In Android i'm able to use an option in Developer Settings called pointer location. I've had no luck finding the iOS equivalent <SEP> if its a native app, you can use appium inspector to locate the coordinates <SEP> Does anyone know "how to start and stop the appium server programatically using java?" Does anyone tried this?? <SEP> @Rohithnm Hi. I think you could do it with bash commands: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26830617/java-running-bash-commands <SEP> Guys, what the best approach to implement logging in to appium(ruby) framework? as I understand - there is no access to appium server logs, and it is unable to put them in to file, with framework specific messages. I'm looking for a way to capture driver level logs(i.e. clicking on elements, waiting etc) and save them to log files.  including logger in to framework methods - looks like not the best approach. <SEP> @brbrr  Hi, I'm using windows OS for Appium <SEP> @Rohithnm ok, anyway, you got the point. run it from os env. <SEP> google is a fancy thing <SEP> this is the first result <SEP> https://discuss.appium.io/t/launching-and-stopping-appium-server-programmtically/700 <SEP> @brbrr  Thanks <SEP> @Simon-Kaz  But it  not working for me :(\ <SEP>  <SEP> is it possible to retrieve an element with its index and resource-id , like :                                  findByXpath("//* <SEP>  findByXpath("//* <SEP> that should work <SEP> Thank you, I just realized that I was mixing Xpath and CSS3 selectors .... <SEP> which test cloud works best with appium? <SEP> How can we run test on android version  <SEP> it supports but id used by selendroid and id used by uiautomator are different <SEP> so script will not work, if you just choose capability to selendroid <SEP> Thanks @priyankshah217 : When i take the screenshot in uiautomator it doesnot show me the resource id in 4.2 version, so how can i make the same script work on previous versions of devices? <SEP> you need to use annotations @FindByAll() within that you can provide locators whichever applicable <SEP> i have sample code let me share link to you <SEP> ok..thanks <SEP> https://github.com/appium/sample-code/blob/master/sample-code/examples/java/junit/src/test/java/com/saucelabs/appium/page_object/android/ApiDemosListViewScreenSimple.java <SEP> you can combine multiple locators and try <SEP> ok so basically we are specifying in case you dont find the id, try searching by some other locator etc <SEP> Thanks Priyank <SEP> is it possible to set some click position offset? As I understand, by default click goes right in to element center. <SEP> With java-client you can use tap with offset : http://appium.github.io/java-client/ <SEP> im having trouble with scrolling to an element with child selector attached to it

I'm running Java appium test case to automate a hybrid app on an Android platform.

Did create 'Actions' object and invoking click using that. Tried 'TouchAction' and it didnt help as well.. Can someone throw light in this area? How in a hybrid app the component in the 'div' tag can be pressed <SEP> so u can open the page in mobile browser which ur testing? <SEP> i got stuck in such scenario where i ws not able to select a spinner in mobile using the class name of that spinner <SEP> but when i launched it on desktop browser <SEP> and took the xpath from desktop and applied ont he mobile <SEP> it worked like a charm <SEP> @mailsathere maybe your div is not loaded maybe you need something like  ```` it('ion-app must be exist', () = <SEP> or  ```` alert = element(by.tagName('ion-alert'));     browser.wait(ExpectedConditions.presenceOf(alert)).then(() = <SEP> but idont know how you do that in java

It seems using moveTo() even with waitAction(), it instantaneously drag & drop. <SEP> Because I need to scroll a horizontal view to drag & drop. <SEP> @calshankar  yes the server is running @ 0.0.0.0:4723 <SEP> can you kindly tell me how to change the capability ? <SEP> did anyone here worked with different languages automation? <SEP> did anyone worked on Sikuli...??? <SEP> please join......https://gitter.im/ajit4848/SikuliXperts <SEP> . <SEP> . <SEP> . <SEP> I hope you guys are joining SikuilExperts. <SEP> @Fanch- Python has a longpress duration argument which can be changed. https://github.com/appium/python-client/blob/787d7dfa02559a698ac2b92d4b474eb2dda5560a/appium/webdriver/common/touch_action.py <SEP> @Fanch-   This code long-presses the Play Store icon and drags it on top of the Camera icon. ``` el1 = self.driver.find_element_by_name('Play Store') el2 = self.driver.find_element_by_name('Camera') action = TouchAction(self.driver) action.long_press(el1).move_to(el2).release().perform() ``` I can change the duration by adding, duration=2000 or other value. The default is 1000. <SEP> Or.... were you asking if moveto method's dragging speed could be changed? <SEP> Exactly, I'm asking if moveTo method's dragging speed could be changed ! <SEP> OK so it might be a java-client improvement. Or waitAction doesn't work as expected. <SEP> Well no, my bad, I want moveTo() speed duration to be customizable, not press or longPress, with Java-client we can also do that with waitAction(). <SEP> Sadly I think it won't, I have the same issue. Sometimes appium is lost and it creates some false negative. <SEP> if session doesnt respond, catch it to kill the existing and restart

<SEP> give me 2 min. <SEP> @LyubomirStoimchev  : So if I think I understand you want to use Appium to confirm the calendar is in french? What is it currently doing now? The only way I see to test for a locale is by setting is via desired capabilities with "Locale" <SEP> There's also Language as well that can be set using : language (Sim/Emu-only) Language to set for the simulator / emulator. On Android, available only on API levels 22 and below <SEP> Let's go a little bit back. I'm currently implementing a way to select a date from android build in calendar (the new one that is material design and not the one with wheels). So far so good. The emulator that I'm running the test in has English as system language but the app itself uses French(or some other non-english language). When you open the calendar while in the app, the system calendar that is opened takes the language from the app and not from the system meaning that the calendar is in French. The problem is that when the calendar is in French all the month values are in french (like "28 aout 2000" instead of "28 august 2000") and I cannot cast them to DateTime object without knowing the Locale. Yes I know I can hardcode the Locale and cast it with that value but I want to make a more general solution in which I detect the locale of the app and use it when casting the objects. <SEP> Also I have tried using the capabilities that you mentioned but the change the system language and not the app language. <SEP> @LyubomirStoimchev : Got it. Sounds like you need to get the current date locally from the device in english and then based on that search for language that should show. <SEP> you have to know the locale first, if you can't get the locale then that's a problem it sounds with the app <SEP> yep.. <SEP> Well I can select day and year without a problem, but for month I need to know the locale.

<SEP> )) <SEP> can you explain please how "url" parameter in json node configuration should work? it seems it didn't affect anything <SEP> let's clear the question :) there are two groups of fields in json node config: url/host/port and hubHost/hubPort. I suspect the second one should be used to communicate between node and hub, the first one - to be passed in response headers to client which seems not working now. Am i right? <SEP> so if you run appium with  appium -a 0.0.0.0 -p 4700  then you replace APPIUM_IP and APPIUM_PORT with the above <SEP> host ip and host port are your selenium grid host details <SEP> but it works, and im happy :D <SEP> Hi, Could anyone tell me whether we can automate fb login process from a native app? I have an app which has Sign Up process through FB. FB Login page is launched externally. It is not within my  native app.
<SEP> Chats and graph is not good candidate for automation. If can be tested, at different levels. 1. You can do API testing, from where it actual rendered Jain <SEP> JSON <SEP> 2. Integration testing. You can call the same API s using web , this can be written in karma.js
<SEP> ok yeah. I don't want it to affect my tests. <SEP> If you want to start a saperated one, you can get the idea from here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/perf-mon/get-started-android <SEP> another question, in my test, I placed assertions on checking if elements are present and compare it with Server data. so it's actually  - checking the element - compare the element So I'm noticing that it's slower compared to my web tests, is that normal? <SEP> is it slower because it goes to appium and then to Xcode, etc? <SEP> ```

I've tried the following, but it won't connect at the "init()" step, I assume as the port is already taken by the running process which was setup with wd.  ``` let webdriverio   = require('webdriverio')  return driver                                 .setupStuff.....     .elementById('myElementId')     .then((el) = <SEP> The error is  ``` test failure: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:4444 ``` <SEP> If I take out the .init() the error becomes: ``` Error: A session id is required for this command but wasn't found in the response payload ``` <SEP> Having a bit of trouble implementing a flick method with admc/wd. <SEP> So I don't care so much about borrowing the method from WebdriverIO if  I can implement the flick gesture some other way. <SEP> Hi All, When i run test in parallel with two emulators, i am getting this  error ``` ERROR: An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.

I need to hold the element and, in the clamped state, transfer it to the coordinates of another element, not letting it keep it in new coordinates. I'm trying to implement this action: touchAction.Press (FirstElement) .moveTo (finishX, finishY) .waitAction (Duration.ofSeconds (wait) ). Release (). Perform (); , but in this case the touchAction completely discards the command, even without moving the element, if I implement this: touchAction.longPress (FirstElement, Duration.ofSeconds (wait) ). moveTo (finishX, finishY) .waitAction (Duration.ofSeconds (wait - 5 )). release (). perform (); the command is also dropped if there is no waitAction () method: touchAction.longPress (FirstElement, Duration.ofSeconds (wait) ). moveTo (finishX, finishY) .release (). perform () ;, the item moves, but I need a delay , help implement waitAction after Press () or longPress, but I need a delay before releasing it .

Suggested that I have iOS.app, xcode, appium, IWDP, iPhone and test working test and everything should work out of the box, however this suggestion is wrong  I'm far from iOS development so I don't quite how things works and supposed that there is no difference between running test on real and emulated device as with Android.  so I'm trying to understand a bottleneck I'm facing with:  1.

No WEBVIEW content, e.g. ISWDP is running fine because without it I cant even launch Safari(same issue - no WEBVIEW found), and application is running using AppiumDriver manually signed  I suggest that both issues has some preconditions to run and I clearly don't understand them, official documentation doesn't helps( at least I couldn't find answer there)  could someone explain this preconditions as for a complete noob  thanx in advance <SEP> Hi All, how I can write test script to test phone dialer <SEP> using appium <SEP> could you please guide me to resolve this , <SEP> Open Application  http://localhost:4723/wd/hub  platformName=Android  platformVersion=8.1.0  deviceName=Redmi     ...    appPackage=com.android.contacts  appActivity=com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity <SEP> I tried this way <SEP> I wanted to test the voice call, to dial a number from my script <SEP> Please help if anyone know about this? <SEP> Hi, is it possible to record (real) user-interaction with an app via appium and then just replay the sequence, when testing the app again? <SEP> @walternolak  just a suggestion: pls avoid using xpath as much as possible <SEP> Any app dev wanna give free service <SEP> @all Appium ios can run without using xcode?

I did try to use the tap button but that also does not helps(shows error) <SEP> I also see that its missing basic features that the mac version has <SEP> so if someone could confirm that the windows app is able to identify ui elements the same way as the mac version does then at least I would know I have a chance to get this work <SEP> in other case I have to look after for other tool <SEP> http://james-willett.com/2016/05/appium-from-scratch-preparing-for-automation-part-1-interrogating-your-app/ <SEP> I found this tutorial <SEP> but guys if the app just has such a limited functionality then can I may ask whats the point of the windows app? starting and stopping the server is not a huge benefit <SEP> David, AFAIK windows app can do everything a Mac based app can for Android <SEP> Having said that, app is good for beginners who might not be comfortable using command line or UiAutomatorViewer <SEP> You actually do not need the app <SEP> Hey Great Flocks <SEP> Just want to know , how is Facebook web driver agent for iPhone automation ? <SEP> Did someone get experience of using it ? <SEP> Specially for iPhone 10 + versions <SEP> I am asking General feedback compate to Test navigator of X-code <SEP> Compare* <SEP> I submitted a bug for the windows client developers https://github.com/appium/appium-dot-exe/issues/175 <SEP> @aniket-21 at the moment the windows app is useless from my point of view. It does not helps basically anything for a beginner. It lacks the most important feature that an inspector must have which is: Help to easily identify elements on the UI <SEP> With UIAutomatorView it just taken me to get to the point in 2 minutes.

<SEP> Any pointers on handling Android permissions/ popup from Protractor would be really helpful please <SEP> @raj8github I don't think appium can handle permissions (atleast I haven't tried). If you mean permission pop ups in android then you can try `adb  shell input keyevent` to accept or reject the permissions. <SEP> Sure thank you.. Let me try that
