<SEP> Hi <SEP>  everyone is optimistic about the rise and fall of the cryptos. personally, you can all agree with me that the bitcoin price is going to exceed its current value to $71,415 in February 2022, panelists have also predicted the bitcoin price to skyrocket to an average of $249,578 by the year 2024 which could also influence the price of altcoins. it's never too late to buy and hold of Ethereum/Bitcoin now is the right time. I personally have sustained over $567,000 since last year still now copying advance trade signals and indicating stop lost and manage risk following a mentorship and a blockchain specialist https://declanbrock.com/ his pattern are very lucrative with full of complex. _ <SEP> @Ahlam910 send me your DM pls <SEP> !
<SEP> Hi <SEP> ethereum buy site ? <SEP> @alperkayadibi_twitter coinbase <SEP> @alperkayadibi_twitter cex.io <SEP> Can anyone explain me about those critical bug on Ether? <SEP> @HubcoinToken_twitter I just checked the version of the code I have and allowances are decremented with transfers, etc... I am certain I've had this code for way longer than 3 days. Maybe some people are spreading rumors to drive Ether value down, so that they can buy some Ether with Bitcoin. <SEP> phalexo, it was fixed just 3 days ago and you can verify it here <SEP> https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org/issues/583 <SEP> There are also proofs with webarchive.org on bitcointalk thread <SEP> Phalexo are you shure that allowances are decrementing on burning ? Its all ok with transfers, problem is on burning <SEP> I see. I don't use that specific function. :-) <SEP> phalexo, But it brokes all allowance system and may hit any token owner who use it.

<SEP> One simple question: where can I download blockchain data ? In a bitcoin I could see all transactions as they are stored in public ledger. <SEP> I mean public blockchain data for ethereum. <SEP> @NinoNaf_twitter Maybe etherscan.io is what you're looking for although I'm not sure if you can download the transactions. <SEP> install Mist or Wallet and the Blockchain will be downloaded into your profile directory by sync from enodes <SEP> Maybe I just need some examples like maxxflyer said
<SEP> Hey guys/anyone that can help  I bought into Ethereum pre-sale/crowd funding, what do I do to redeem them now?  Thanks <SEP> @Abudinho download the client you see linked. Run it. Follow instructions from there. <SEP> What Client? Where is the link please? <SEP> Are you on the website ethereum.org ? <SEP> Yes <SEP> Then there should be a blue button on the top. First link. <SEP> Download that. <SEP> Are you talking about the "smart money, smart wallet" <SEP> I don't see any blue button at the top of the page <SEP> Yes. Its the client. Do you see a blue download button near it? <SEP> wallet web? <SEP> No <SEP> "windows 32 bit is not yet supported" ? <SEP> why walleb web??? <SEP> @alexvandesande Hi again. Im on the etherwallet-site and in the view-wallet-section. I managed to decrypt with my code to see the balance....but when i go into the send-transaction i says wrong password. Is there 2 passwords? <SEP> @pomjup53 you should ask the guys who built etherwallet site <SEP> woho it works now <SEP> @alexvandesande now when i got the ethers in the ethereum-wallet its still the password that didnt work that i got to use when sending funds? Because it says wrong password when i trying to send ethers. <SEP> From my main-account to my second wallet <SEP> @alexvandesande It worked again. Strange. Can i change password somewhere? Im getting paranoid
<SEP> wanna ask about the use case for ethereum. how does smart contract really work? i'm not really interested for payment method. but interested for how dapps can work with ethereum. <SEP> my current webapp is entertainment database app, like imdb. but it has a lot more content. not just a list of text and image <SEP> can i really get advantage by adopting ethereum into my webap?
<SEP> any admin here ? <SEP> in my ethereum wallet 10 txn pending since 4 hours <SEP> they are disappearing and appearing again n again

Crypto is for the rest of us then <SEP> this is complete bullshit <SEP> market manipulation, same as its ever been <SEP> Chinese exchanges are still up - https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/6z1k6f/huobi_and_btcchina_statements_regarding_recent/ <SEP> here's what I've seen <SEP> ICO ban definitely occurred <SEP> one left voluntarily <SEP> The Chinese are doing us a favor. Less competition from their exchanges. <SEP> The citizens will go to Hong Kong or Taiwan or Australia and still invest in foreign ICOs. <SEP> same as it ever was <SEP> i wonder if these horrible Chinese translations are actually accurate and that's how Chinese talk <SEP> this market is maturing <SEP> "We do not have too much panic, holding the bitcoin can still point to point <SEP> Possible, that is, but on however it is I hope that others of lands far speak downside up for sakes unknown <SEP> anyways whatever, we all know China is extremely oppressive and crypto is a form of free speech, something they loathe, so no wonder they're banning it <SEP> The amazing thing is that is still possible to understand your mangled speech. So the meaning is mostly in the words, not in the order of the words. <SEP> I don't think china is actually banning it - seems to be more of a temporary measure to control scams with ICOs and stuff <SEP> Bribes will be given to the Politburo and everything will be fine again. <SEP> @andrewevans Presearch? What's that? <SEP> haha yeah but it can't stay this bad and also scale - I'm getting 10 scam ether addresses a day on slack; new crypto users can't be expected to have to sift through this kind of stuff every time <SEP> needs to be made usable by the wide public, which requires regulation to take it away from its current state <SEP> @andrewevans Ok, but how many idiots are required to perform this search? <SEP> @phalexo no you dont understand. It was "seen on CNBC" so it doesnt matter <SEP> @andrewevans I was joking. How is it different from regular search? <SEP> it's "decentralized" <SEP> of course so far there is almost no product whatsoever, but they have youtube video with uplifting music

Most comfortable with Windows PC. <SEP> why does not anyone answer yet? <SEP> why was this chat created so no  one would help? <SEP> I'm starting to feel that this is all a scam <SEP> @Christos10 you think there is someone who can help us? <SEP> hello, how to import entire ether live chain to a database.. any tool? <SEP> Hi...i want know about eth hardwork get etz coin, is it happen or cancel it? <SEP> Hi...i want to know about eth hardwork get etz coin, is it happen or cancel it? <SEP> ask the right questions and you will get answers <SEP> nobody puts his time into answering questions people easily could find answers for by themselves <SEP> @clarkvasile GPUs are expensive, yes, nothing you can do about it happy with this answer? <SEP> you are the one wanting something, not? <SEP> not your decision <SEP> they buy wery few
<SEP> good day <SEP> admin how can i download it <SEP> are download is not working <SEP> what? <SEP> @alexvandesande @chafey I replaced my old wallet with the new one and now it's as if any information that was stored by the application is gone. <SEP> It's downloading blocks and asking me to set passwords. <SEP> As if any accounts that were there before are gone. <SEP> And it's asking me to make new ones. <SEP> Good thing I didn't have any main net accounts. <SEP> @willnwhite i think we need more context.. not clear what you are doing <SEP> @jarredchase__twitter Thanks! <SEP> @willnwhite always make backups of your account keys, make sure they are safe, if you lose them you won't be able to access your funds, so any hardware or software failure won't be trouble. Ethereum Wallet changed the folder where the keys are stored, your old ones are not lost, they are in the old place (that path depends if you are in unix based system or windows). <SEP> I downloaded mist and am now using it to hold my main Ethereum wallet.. is that the best way to hold my eth? <SEP> @3esmit I'm on Mac OS X. <SEP> @chafey I have updated Ethereum Wallet to 0.8.9 by dragging the downloaded file onto my Applications folder and choosing "Replace" when it told me there was an existing version of the wallet. When I've then opened 0.8.9, it's as if I never used the previous version: it's asking me to set passwords for accounts, and it's downloading all the blocks. <SEP> @willnwhite ok i understand now - that is surprising!  I am not a user of ethereum wallet so can't help you :( <SEP> @3esmit I still have my password, so I'm hoping if I can find the keys I can get my accounts back. <SEP> Is there an application whose job it is to hold on to cryptocurrency keys? <SEP> wallets are supposed to do that :) <SEP> Right! It seems though that they should be separate concerns. <SEP> The way that a password manager is separate to a browser. <SEP> well sort of, there is a JSON representation of an ethereum account (private key) that is widely used (geth uses it - probably ethereum wallet does too) <SEP> since it is in a file, you can easily . back it up and move it between different apps <SEP> another option is using a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s <SEP> It seems that upgrading Ethereum Wallet has wiped the keys. So it makes sense that a wallet application shouldn't handle them at all. <SEP> i am surprised that upgrading it wiped them... <SEP> Because the focus of a wallet application upgrade will not necessarily be on preserving the keys, rather some other functionality that wallets have. <SEP> other apps don't do that <SEP> well the whole point of a wallet is to manage your keys <SEP> But wallets also connect to the network etc.. <SEP> i see your point but its not so cut and dry <SEP> if you had a "wallet manager" which only managed keys <SEP> and a "separate app" that talked to the wallet manager when it needed keys <SEP> you would need to secure the connection between the app and the wallet manager <SEP> to avoid exposing private keys <SEP> and that has all sorts of issues <SEP> so it seems that the keys themselves are portable <SEP> and can be moved between apps <SEP> and the apps usually have import/export functionality for keys <SEP> so its up to the user to manage them mostly <SEP> but - what you describe with ethereum wallet sounds REALLY unusual, i am surprised it did what you describe!!! <SEP> upgrading an app shiould never lose the keys <SEP> and to clarify terminoklogy - a wallet protects a single private key <SEP> what you are describing sounds like a wallet manager <SEP> Password managers must have solved this problem though. <SEP> I'm trying to find out where the keys may be stored on my computer (Mac OS X).
<SEP> Hi everyone <SEP> how to install ethereum in redhat linux <SEP> @elytslooc  the addresses are the same so as long as you have the keyfile and pw of the  accounbt you are fine <SEP> Good day yesterday evening  I send Atheneums to my wallet, but they do not show in the wallet how come? <SEP> @geraldbucshon The wallet you are using, I believe it is using geth or Go Ethereum. I have been looking for a solution to sync my wallet for over 6 months. It is broken. Try using MyEtherWallet instead. And send any donation to declare.oprah2024.eth thank you <SEP> @geraldbucshon When the new version of geth comes out, I will try running that in command line without the ethereum walllet app open. I know guys who bought brand new computers and it still never syncs <SEP> @geraldbucshon Additionally, if you have almost the whole chain loaded but the last 100-300 blocks never catch up, close the wallet and save what you got onto an external hard drive before using geth rdbase command to remove your database and start all over.  I've removed the database almost a hundred times across multiple computers because that's what web forums say to do. It just wastes your time. Keep a good copy of what you have at all times. <SEP> You can type declare.oprah2024.eth instead of my whole wallet address to send me a tip for my explanation of what you are dealing with. Alternatively, you could also send a tip to decline.oprah2024.eth if that works better for you <SEP> wallet of ETH for Android <SEP> Hey guys! I have a noob question about ethereum node. I don't know all the details of how the Ethereum node works, but here's my current understanding of it:  When I run Ethereum node (Parity) on OSX via docker I need to expose the following ports:      8545, 8456 - that's for json rpc (I guess)      8080, 8180 - that's for ui (I guess)      30303 (tcp+udp) - that's for p2p connections (I guess)  Looks like these ports are open for inbound connections on MacOS by default. Looks like if somebody has an access to json-rpc nodes they can attack the node by smth like "execute transaction as soon as someone unlocks the wallet". Also it looks like that it sort of cannot be done when node is run locally just because of Internet Service Provider doesn't expose your IP address to the internet.  So I'm kind of confused and would appreciate if someone clarify at least some of these questions:  1) Are the descriptions above accurate?  2) While I don't have public IP, there are still some connections by peer nodes active. How's that possible? Will these peers be able to connect to json-rpc ports and use node api?  3) What are good security measures to run node safely? Block any 8xxx port for inbound connections? Maybe there's a good guide for it?  4) What information is available to somebody who can connect to node? All eth accounts, but they're locked, so until somebody supply a password they can't do anything?  5) If someone steals json keystore - is it possible to unlock it without knowing the password (assuming good password difficulty) <SEP> @alleycat-at-git   yes, but these are are only accessible to localhost by default. only 30303 is outbound. Having an open rpc is a huge security risk. Lots of ETH stolen this way. People could access all functions specified in --rpcapi. Including sending tx when the wallet is unlocked. Unlocking the wallet requires the pw since the keyfile is encrypted with the pw <SEP> @alleycat-at-git  Perhaps this could guide you https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3887/how-to-reduce-the-chances-of-your-ethereum-wallet-getting-hacked  In case you are interested/intent to have Nginx as reverse-proxy server to connect to the nodes via SSL/TLS for Ethereum JSON-RPC-API, this is also good ... https://tokenmarket.net/blog/protecting-ethereum-json-rpc-api-with-password/

Probably couldn't connect. Retrying in 1... miner  11:57:21|main  Getting work package...   X  11:57:22|main  Failed to submit hashrate.   X  11:57:22|main  Dynamic exception type: class jsonrpc::JsonRpcException std::exception::what: Exception -32003 : Client connector error: libcurl error: 7 - <SEP> I'm also currently downloading the blockchain <SEP> @anonymuse If you have an empty/missing `chaindata` directory then the fastest way is by running `geth --fast`.  If your `chaindata` folder isn't empty though then 24 hours is a reasonable target. <SEP> I believe a good target for `geth --fast` is an hour or two. <SEP> I'm running pyethapp, and using morden, so I was assuming that syncing would be much quicker. <SEP> @Edvin003 Mining or transfer from BitCoin via an exchange are the two most common ways. <SEP> I don't know anything about `pyethapp`. <SEP> ok thanks <SEP> And you can point `geth` at TEST-NET if you like.
<SEP> pls how do i log into my ethereum account? <SEP> You don't have an ethereum account you have either a wallet on an exchange or wallet on you device such as computer hard drive, phone app or cold storage device like Trezor or Nano -s . <SEP> Any account would be with the exchange you trade on or on line wallet such as MyEtherWallet. <SEP> I sent coins to the address wallet of the Ethereum Wallet.I do not see them because synchronization is very slow.I have an account on MyEtheriumWallet.How can I see my coins on MyEtheriumWallet from the Etherium Wallet adress? <SEP> All you should have to do is log on to MyEthereumWallet go to your wallet and check the transaction history to see if they got the coins. you can also check with the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer to see if the coins got sent. <SEP> What is the total amount of tokens that can be mined? <SEP> It depends on what token you are talking about they are all different but you can check by going to  https://coinmarketcap.com/ and navegate to the individual coin page there you will see the  data for each coin or token <SEP> For etherum coinmarketcap doesn't show a total <SEP> Go to the source https://www.ethereum.org/ <SEP> Tokens came to adress of the EthereumWallet, but I do not see them because synchronization is very long.Can I use the address with my tokens of the EthereumWallet in MyEthereumWallet? <SEP> @levcoin88  Not sure what you are asking but I think you will need to wait for sync to happen then you should be able to see it on  the blockchain explorer. all transactions have to verified before they post. <SEP> Also where did you  send them from? I have a similar situation where I sent ETH from bitstamp to Cryptopia and it has been over two weeks and I still have not seen them. <SEP> Afternoon guys hey how do i get my money out of etherscan? its stuck there cause my wallet is taking forever to finish. thx in advance <SEP> Etherscan is a Blockchain explorer you cant do anything with that except look at transactions on the blockchain. <SEP> The only way to move crypto is by the interface on your wallet whether it is on an exchange or hard device app such as phone, comp hard drive or vault such as Trezor or Nano-S. and having the privet key.
<SEP> Hello. Is this coin transfer slow? <SEP> Hello, how can i get good ether cloud mining? <SEP> Screw ethereum. <SEP> fucking ethereum. <SEP> Slow as in what. The average transaction time on Bitcoin is 3500 minutes right now: https://blockchain.info/charts/avg-confirmation-time For Ethereum, it is something like 10 minutes, with a low gas. https://etherscan.io/chart/blocktime . So what do you mean slow? #factsmatter <SEP> As if advances in technology depend on your personal investments. <SEP> i mean cloud mininnig? <SEP> Or can I email someone?
<SEP> Hello, i am looking for ethereum integration with php <SEP> I don't need smart contracts, i am interested by them at all, and i noticed that many people there are looking for a simple/tutorial about how to integrate eth or etc or a smart contract into their website, and use it as payment method. Look at this guy https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/7424/new-merchant-here-running-node-have-question-please-help no one helped him, and i am asking the same question, how to integrate ethereum in a website using php, with walletnotify, account management, and some tips about security, and how to close all IPs to the API except the localhost IP. Bitcoin does all of this natively, very easy to use, so please, make ethereum as easy to integrate and use as bitcoin is. <SEP> Hello i have downloaded the smart wallet from this site. i purchased 50 eth on bitpanda and it does not sync with my wallets. its still on 0% and no eth on my account, what do to? URGENT!!!
<SEP> Is there an official token name registry?  Does it cost anything?  I see eth.namereg on geth console but I'm not sure how to use it and many pages found online seem to be outdated. <SEP> @ANTco the history of transactions is bloated and geth is not purning data. Acutally its about 10GB, but only if you use `geth --fast` to launch wallet daemon <SEP> @kenwalker88 You probably have mist... Try the following: Delete your chain and run with `geth --fast`. If you don't know how to do that, I can instruct you. <SEP>   @erastotle  `geth --fast` download first the block headers, than latest state and than the transaction history, so the blockchain is not bloated. IMHO should be the default behavior for mist <SEP> @alexvandesande users having issues syncing and big chaindata, why not `geth --fast`as default? <SEP> @kenwalker88 What is your operational system? <SEP> @3esmit Ok - that wasn't me asking about getting started, I am running OK but I have a question about how to use namereg - if there is a decided-on name registry <SEP> thanks @3esmit I can just delete chaindata folder contents and run geth --fast vs. geth accounts new? <SEP> `geth accounts new` is other command, just used for creating accounts in your keystroke folder, it does not run the client <SEP> @3esmit Ok - is there one that is an official registry that is used by Mist etc? <SEP> @erastotle Don't know how much it costs, but its experimental yet <SEP> @3esmit ah ok, 0xc6d9d2cd449a754c494264e1809c50e34d64562b is the contract referenced by eth.namereg() <SEP> BTW, Ethcore Parity have a name registry too... <SEP> @3esmit great - thank you <SEP> @erastotle All you need to know for now is here https://github.com/ethereum/ens/wiki and that you need to run into Ropsten Chain (Testnet) <SEP> @3esmit I will read about that.  I am referring to token names, like for new cryptocurrencies, if that makes any difference to the answer -- i.e. if I wanted to make a new cryptocurrency called Erastcoin <SEP> @erastotle  Maybe this https://ethereum.org/token ? <SEP> You can try parity, which have a token deployer builtin... <SEP> @erastotle see <SEP> This is only used by parity but it's avaliable on blockchain, so it would be usable by any wallet in future, if this is adopted, but I wouldn't relay on that <SEP> @ANTco  http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/1161/what-is-geths-fast-sync-and-why-is-it-faster For running mist on fast... (windows) 1. Delete chainfolder `%AppData%\Ethereum\geth\chaindata` 2. run geth in fast mode `%AppData%\Mist\binaries\Geth\unpacked\geth.exe --fast` <SEP> @3esmit Thanks. I haven't dl'ed mist, but will. I kicked off 'geth --fast' in console <SEP> I checked out mist before, it's nice

<SEP> Hi <SEP> Are there any mining m achine that i can buy? <SEP> To mine this coin or do i have to use graphic card? <SEP> hello im new here. Hope to learn more about ethereum. :smile: <SEP> I have not received my ethereum in my ethereum wallet since 4 days and i have mail regarding to ether support, but there is no reponse till now. Anyone can help <SEP> sorry im new here. dont know how i can help. :) <SEP> thanks for reply dear, but i am surprised no one i replying here <SEP> i have dropped a message yesterday also, but no reply <SEP> but still i am expecting :) <SEP> Should I continue learning C++ and then Eth, or should I learn Solidity, JavaScript or Go/Geth? <SEP> @navtej86 dear may i ask you something very beginner? <SEP> my Mist window has 3 icons on the bottom left, from the look of them, i think it is trying to download the all the blocks since beginning of time. should i continue to wait until everything's downloaded before i can see Ethereum in action? <SEP> @ierosvin sorry bro i don't have any idea on it <SEP> no problem <SEP> @jamesray1 in my opinion, learn the javasacript way. you will get more community support as there are bunch of javascript developers <SEP> @navtej86  you can look up the status of your transaction in the blockexplorer, http://etherscan.io/ . Plz provide your address or TX-ID for Details <SEP> @ierosvin  to have a full node, you need to wait for all the block to have the full ethereum experience. you could start wallet with --node-light to have a light client that only downloads the blockheaders <SEP> @zygopok leaving your coins on an exchange is a risk,  you should move it to a wallet where you controll the private key. BACKUP your keyfile or seed. Your really have to backup your keyfile or seed. <SEP> Did I say you have to Backup your  keyfile or seed? There really is no court or helpdesk or anything when you loose your key <SEP> @DustyHidan  there are tutorials to build a mining rig with graphic cards, Yes ethash is asic-resistant so GPUs are the way to go <SEP> @heyrhett try parity <SEP> @Raveltsi_twitter when you see your TX in the blockexplorer http://etherscan.io/ your node is probably not synced. leave it a night syncing or try starting your node in lightclient mode <SEP> @someone235 take a look at jaxx, its a multicoin wallet <SEP> @vanizakibola_twitter  yes there is an ethereum wallet for android, its called ethereum wallet you can get it per playstore or apk <SEP> you can also try jaxx on android <SEP> guys when i try to download with --fast, do i need to download everything at once? My laptop was on all night, died and now when I try to start --fast again I get   I0507 11:30:08.345791 eth/handler.go:119 <SEP> yes unfortunatly --fast only work when you start from scratch <SEP> O_O lol <SEP> but how can it be continued to latest blocks? <SEP> what is the size of the main blockchain? downloading now :S <SEP> it continuous with the normal sync mode, the size is around 10-15 GB but it also need to prosess the TXs, if your in a hurry you can start in light mode <SEP> Hi any HD wallet for eth ? I couldn't find any <SEP> what about the main blockchain? What size is that? <SEP> --fast is currently 18gb someone told me yesterday <SEP> your client doesnt just store the blockchain in disk, it prosesses all the TX in the chain and calcs the current state. And this state is stored on disk, so the amount of space varies.  The exact size of the blockchain is probablly much smaler <SEP> what is light client? <SEP> ok <SEP> not sure till when it will fully synced <SEP> :worried: <SEP> 987462
<SEP> What GPU are recommended for best performance? <SEP> What is the best out there? <SEP> Why do I wanna own Ether, what kinda of transactions can I make with it? I don't understand this completely. You can design your own cryptocurrency but to what exactly do I need Ether?
<SEP> Bjdjd <SEP> Hola <SEP> Did anyone read my post and can I get an answer please <SEP> Hello I am new to crypto and have a question about wallets and exchanges. If I sent EHT from bitstamp exchange  to cryptopia exchange and then I found out that cyrptopia does not accept ETH from bitstamp because bitstamp uses contracts which I was told are internal...what ever that means. Yet when I check Ether blockchain explorer it says sent successful. Bitstamp says it sent but cryptopia says they cant accept it. So where is my ETH and how do I get it back? <SEP> @sh4d0v1  You seem to be know what your talking about can you tell me if there is a way to get my coins back? <SEP> @jayzyme_twitter if the transaction from bitstamp was successfully mined into the chain the coins are at cryptopia you made a classic newbie mistake to try to send ETH between exchanges directly <SEP> can I get them back <SEP> talk to their support, they will have to credit your ETH by hand <SEP> So it is possible they can give them back <SEP> you just made them work by not using their automatisms correctly <SEP> they have it, they probably will give it back after some time <SEP> can take month <SEP> Im not sure what you are saying but is it that they now have to do it by hand and it will take time? <SEP> yes <SEP> Thank you very much i appreciate your tiem <SEP> time <SEP> Why does it take SO LONG to get my wallet to sync? I've been trying for over a week with no luck! It keeps getting stuck, only DL'ing maybe 1,000 blocks before I have to restart it! <SEP> I've left it on for several days straight but it won't DL more than 1,000 to 2,000 blocks before freezing. <SEP> Hi guys, please tell me if will be a fork on 19th of the ETH? I read about this and I saw one website http://etherzero.org/index.html that sell ETHZERO. Is a scam? <SEP> @Chris46319_twitter that is a real problem, the network is congested again <SEP> you could try the Parity wallet, it syncs much faster <SEP> @madalinavram85 there are forks all the time, don't spend your money on something you don't understand <SEP> if you want to buy a ETH fork then buy Ethereum Classic (ETC) <SEP> I've already got ETH waiting to get into this wallet. I'm at 4.1M and I need to get to 4.8M All my connections are good. Plenty of available bandwidth. I've even stopped mining just so I can open up more bandwidth. The thing is, it shouldn't just stop. I get the congestion and all. Still, no excuse for just stopping altogether. <SEP> It is very bad, ETH isn't really scalable <SEP> Contact our blockchain technical support for anybody who's having  problem with their transaction  ltrh1508@gmail.com <SEP> stop scamming  @EthereumBTC_twitter

<SEP> que bueno <SEP> @Zoltu keeping money in blockchain is good idea:) <SEP> As long as you are okay with the value volatility, I agree. <SEP> Metropolis and Serenity are on the roadmap. <SEP> Metropolis is focused on polishing the experience.  Getting the marketplace up, making sure some high quality dApps available, improving the Mist GUI as much as reasonable, etc. <SEP> You can think of Metropolis as GA (general availability).  In a traditional company, this would be when you really start marketing the product. <SEP> Serenity can be thought of as Ethereum 2.0.  Proof of Stake is the big change everyone is  talking about for Serenity release. <SEP> http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/406/where-is-the-updated-ethereum-roadmap <SEP> https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/ <SEP> (a lite client wouldn't require the entire blockchain). <SEP> Something that is nice about Ethereum over BitCoin is that there is a roadmap and vision.  BitCoin always came off to me as, "we could do X if we need to in the future" but without any real plan of doing X. <SEP> Ethereum (at least at the moment) appears to have strong vision, a reasonably long-term roadmap, and quite a bit of active development. <SEP> If you have either `geth` or `Mist` open, yes. <SEP> Are people running homestead contributing to making the blockchain decentralized? <SEP> Who is responsible for making the blockchain decentralized? <SEP> No one in particular.  Everyone who runs a full node "participates" in the network.
<SEP> hi guys ... im starting to use ethereum and cant creat contracts ...  0xb6ca4c8ec4d915d58bc9588e9a795eda73524c0a18dcc1c2bd9856d8eec3920c <SEP> can u guys help me? <SEP> @RobsonVentura22 How and what do you need? <SEP> :laughing:  LOL... ! Vitaliks says hey-hey-hey... @ https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/82frsc/vitalik_says_hey_hey_heyyy/ <SEP> hw <SEP> Thank you Alice@TheHive for looking into it. But our setup is on Ubuntu and NOT windows. We are not worried about our performance at the moment. <SEP> Let me share the ldb files growth in our system since we started observing this <SEP> 3 Mar - 3 ldb files <SEP> 4 Mar - 4 ldb files <SEP> 5 MAr - 34 ldb files <SEP> Alice@TheHive i need creat a currency ... id creat the contract 20 hours ago and nothing ... <SEP> 6 Mar - 585 ldb files <SEP> 7 Mar - 4783 ldb files <SEP> 8 Mar - 41628 ldb files <SEP> each ldb files is approx 2 MB <SEP> The blockhains are accumulating the records... <SEP> All our nodes are in sync with same number of blocks <SEP> Each filesize is approx 2MB and thousands of file will be created... When I shared about NTFS degradation issue, its a remote issue of Windows NTFS itself. File of 2MB size will be created no matter what OS your are running. <SEP> ahhh ... all tokens (1kk) are created when the contract is created? <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl As mentioned earlier, all the `.ldb` files are interconnected. <SEP> @AliceTheHive , Yes agreed and 2 MB files makes. But our concern is the increase in number of ldb files by 10 times in a single day <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl There'll be significant increase definitely... <SEP> everyday now its increasing by 10 times which we did not observe for 2 months <SEP> good day!  I am aware that the Ethereum network requires money on the public blockchain to add contracts and process transactions which can get really expensive.  Does it require your money to run an application and process transactions on your own private blockchain? <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl When you said private, am not sure how your `private` setup is.  The Ethereum blockchain is big, and **if** you are running a full node you are downloading all transactions, all contract internal transactions and all block hash information. This takes a lot of space, expect it to become lots more. You can delete the database from your hdd and let it download again. You will then received a pruned version without all details. New blocks will receive all details again. <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl Whenever a block/new block comes in, the .ldb's will add-up. <SEP> @AliceTheHive , Our private blockchain is setup with only 4 nodes running <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl are you required to use gas or Ether to process transactions and to upload Smart Contracts into your private network? <SEP> @subhasis-dgsl How is your private-chain transactions - are they in huge volumes? <SEP> @AliceTheHive , Our transaction volume for each day is 35K to 40K <SEP> Wow...that's a lot... <SEP> Amazing... <SEP> @AliceTheHive , Yeah it is amazing but we are clueless. One correction - today we observed 632 ldb files created for 1 node...May be that's because we were trying to query transactions from eth - console <SEP> Hi guys...i have an ETH node running for a project and i would like to add it to ethstats.net  I tried to join the skype chat but doesn't look like you can anymore.. with windows 10 and the skype app.. i just need the WS_SECRET - anyone that can help here?

<SEP> Hi All, Am trying create Block chain dev environment based on MongoDB. Do any one know how to be done ? <SEP> @thiruthuvarajan_twitter What? <SEP> hi @kayabaNerve  I followed the below link https://webassets.mongodb.com/_com_assets/collateral/mongodb_blockchain.pdf?_ga=2.31991358.1240656896.1504720607-1136552836.1495734678 <SEP> Based on this MongoDB provides some additional features. So I would like to know , How do I do the setup for Blockchain  development ? <SEP> can some one answer me that does ethereum enough to create Block chain app ? <SEP> because blockchain requires some NO SQL database right ? <SEP> Question about ENS Registar. How they say that the bids are hidden, if anyone can see the state and the transaction history in the blockchain? <SEP> I would like to understand what I have to do to start using ethereum <SEP> @Aminadav You have to hash your data. <SEP> If it hashed how ENS contract, knows who is the winner? <SEP> @Aminadav It works off the hashes and you submit the value that was hashed to prove you're the hash. <SEP> I'm understand. I read this  <SEP> Is it mean that someone can cancel my `domain`? <SEP> @thiruthuvarajan_twitter A blockchain is a database of it's own. apparently, MongoDB offers a blockchain version of itself. That's not related to Ehereum though. <SEP> And Ethereum uses it's own blockchain software IIRC <SEP> @Aminadav No <SEP> A smart contract is REST <SEP> It only does stuff when told to do stuff <SEP> So if a domain is no longer valid, yet the contract thinks it is because it never checked, and someone points that out, they can collect a fee <SEP> OK. I'm understand. invalidate a domain that is no valid. Thx <SEP> @kayabaNerve  many thanks :) Where can I download this IIRC :worried: <SEP> IIRC? That means "If I recall correctly" <SEP> Ethereum's code is on Github <SEP> MongoDB is also on Github IIRC <SEP> I have never used MongoDB and can't help you with that <SEP> I would recommend going to a MongoDB chat channel <SEP> For Ethereum, you can get Geth and easily create a fake network by using a new genesis block <SEP> But as Mongo DB can handle a variety of data. Ethereum handles balances of users, program code, and storage found in contracts <SEP> So MongoDB is what you want for a personal general purpose blockchain <SEP> why ENS is loading dictionary? What is this dictionary? <SEP> But again, that's best discussed in a MongoDB place <SEP> @Aminadav Used for hashes IIRC <SEP> You know Mnemonic keys? <SEP> @kayabaNerve  Thanks a lot . :) I will check :+1: <SEP> How is it realted to here? <SEP> Those are used to represent data in a easier to use way <SEP> I'm pretty sure ENS does the same thing <SEP> When you register for an ENS, you use words as a secret key <SEP> check it out on MyEtherWallet (no need to actually open an auction; just act like you will) <SEP> ok. what is "open without bidding", I'm not understand that button <SEP> They are not explaining that button <SEP> LOL It's beta software made for technical people <SEP> I'm a technical guy, navigate my way in the Ether' world. <SEP> Then you should understand that the docs aren't complete for whatever reason and either ask an ENS group or go look yourself <SEP> I'm not complaining. I'm asking here :) <SEP> I never said you were complaining :P <SEP> "Then you should understand..." sounds like... <SEP> Who are you? Are you in the team of Ether? <SEP> From where is what you know about Eth? <SEP> I just said that we didn't write the software. You could do best by finding a Ethereum Name Service Chatroom or viewing the code <SEP> I am me. I'm not part of the Ethereum Foundation. I do not actively write code for it.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> hi <SEP> you still there <SEP> I am using the Original Ethereum Wallet and my Ether has not shown up even though it has completed all the Tx? HElp please <SEP> Hi! If I develop something cool for the Ethereum project, does that mean that I can be hired by the Ethereum project assuming that other people also think it is cool? <SEP> Hi Joseph. I am on the same boat <SEP> did a few transactions and it is not showing up.
<SEP> The ethereum transactions delayed.. <SEP> canceled <SEP> why?? <SEP> No clarification from ethereum pdoject team?? <SEP> hey, am new here <SEP> can anyone tell me what i can do here
<SEP> How well is the new update going? Any reported bugs? Is the Improvement very significant ?) <SEP> where is Byzantium Fork <SEP> Is Byzantium is testnet or real net
<SEP> Just opened to screen shot for you <SEP> There is something saying testnet near that block sync field? <SEP> it's fully compatible and your wallets are automatically imported. <SEP> but ethereum wallet should work fine, it always works for me as well
<SEP> hello <SEP> i need to know how do i get <SEP> my  <SEP> when i downloaded the wallet all it is doing is downloading 4 million nodes <SEP> `Quiark` you can't really. There is no admin. <SEP> how use api <SEP> how to use api search wallet addr <SEP>  How to use java to develop smart contracts on ethereum? <SEP> `Quiark` Mitty-walter, you cant <SEP> @Mitty-walter  there is one project by david roon to to smart contracts in java http://www.davidroon.com/ethcontractapi/ <SEP>  @lukas-berlin thanks! <SEP> `Quiark` yeah but you can't write the contract itself in Java <SEP> Can I use java instead of solidity <SEP> `Quiark` oh, here comes my moment! Mitty-walter: no! :P <SEP> @Mitty-walter  not yet. There is no Compiler Form Java to EVM-bytecode i know oft. <SEP> `Quiark` you wouldn't want to use it anyway given how prohibitively expensive each EVM instruction is <SEP> yeah,thanks <SEP> @Mitty-walter  there are client implementations written in these different languages <SEP>  Hello everyone!

<SEP> hi - I am a coder on Ubuntu 1804, looking into Ethereum with the `aleth` code base.. I built and ran tests.. I assume now is the time to synch to the main chain.. I am in the US, but wary of exposing my IP address here.. <SEP> what aleth options might I use to synch to the main chain now?  I see the --help options <SEP> aleth 1.4.0rc7 <SEP> impatiently, I executed `aleth -M` #deprecated mining test.. and it is obviously synching now.. other newb advice welcome however <SEP> ok - more than 24 hours, and this `aleth` is still syncing.. I see about 24GB so far.. according to this, I have a long way to go ?  https://etherscan.io/chart2/chaindatasizefast <SEP> should I actually kill this and try geth in fast mode ? <SEP> .. hate to waste effort <SEP> any feedback on the PPA for ubuntu bionic ?   I would probably use that for a go install <SEP> .. reading a couple of blog posts (2018) I see people citing the disk I/O .. I am watching the disk I/O and that is not the bottleneck here, with `aleth` <SEP> `geth` installed via PPA -- seems to be good.. easy!
<SEP> hello <SEP> is there any chance I can download ETH WALLET ON MOBILE PHONE OR PLAY STORE <SEP> what is ethereum? is it like bitcoin <SEP> my ether is lost ... where is support? <SEP> @jarviskhan119_twitter  Ethereum is like bitcoin in the sense it is a cryptocurrency technology. <SEP> @hatsoff412 Ah. the risks of crypto.  You can try to contact the exchange you worked through. But typically... :worried: <SEP> so where might one acquire some test ether in order to test casper? <SEP> hello and a happy new year! <SEP> Why I can sync the wallet ? Anyone has any clue? It takes forever.
<SEP> Hello, please pardon this intrusion. May I ask some questions about Ethereum here as an absolute amateur? I'm a writer interested in incorporating it into a story. <SEP> this is the place <SEP> Awesome! I greatly appreciate it. <SEP> What are you writing about? <SEP> Again, what I'm writing is fiction, but I would like to tie it to some real-world concerns, specifically privacy and digital selfhood. <SEP> I'm taking an old superhero character and repurposing him for a series on activism and resistance. The series, KISMET, MAN OF FATE, should begin online in May -- and be collected in print come 2018. <SEP> Reading <SEP> Jamie Bartlett's THE DARK NET gave the the though that I should be incorporating crypto efforts ("cypherpunk?") into the storyline. <SEP> Would it be absolute rubbish nonsense to have someone try to use Ethereum with their Lifenaut account? (Lifenaut is a project to create "mindclones" from "mindfiles," replicating consciousness online. Non-fiction!)
<SEP> https://gitter.im/ethereum/topics/topic/5a6bddb7c95f22546dee2fe7/receive-eth-and-send-user-tokens-problem    Can anybody help me? <SEP> Hi there, Can you please help me?

<SEP> Hi guys <SEP> I'd like to help some people. <SEP> hello  andrew <SEP> i am new to ethereum and will ethereum take over bitcoin?when all are busy buying bitcoins? <SEP> I don't work for Ethereum, I've only been using it for a day or so, but I'd like to help. <SEP> Ethereum has the support of major companies like Microsoft and VISA <SEP> yes ,i am just looking for opinions and help. <SEP> Ethereum is very different than bitcoin. <SEP> different as if?can we invest in it as of bitcoin? <SEP> You can invest in it. The investment is different, though. The differences are good and very promising. <SEP> can you guide me for same investing in it and knowing more about it <SEP> If you look at the website, Ethereum.org, you'll notice that they use the word platform. They call ethereum a platform. Bitcoin is currency while Ethereum is a platform. <SEP> okay <SEP> When you hear the word platform, or digital platform, you probably think of something like "Google" or "Windows" -- and that is a good way to think about it. <SEP> What the "Ethereum Platform" does is similar to gas, or oil. Just as you have a car and the car uses gas -- you can have a "program" or a "website" that is powered by ethereum. <SEP> The value of ethereum has gone up 3700% this year. It is only 2 years old I think. <SEP> Programs and websites are being made, right now, that are powered by Ethereum. Microsoft and VISA are making software on it. <SEP> Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a number. It works very similarly, but  you cannot have a bitcoin powered anything. You can only have the number and exchange a number of bitcoin. <SEP> how buying ethereum will serve  us ,as for making monetary gains?cant it be like we buy ethereum and keep it as in locking period and make gains by selling it as prices rises?can it be done? <SEP> Yes. It can be done. The value of ethereum will go up with more popularity. <SEP> In 1 day, more ethereum is transferred than all other coins combined. Bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, iota coin, all of them combined are used less than ethereum is in a 24 hour period and ethereum. <SEP> where we can buy them? <SEP> is there any app like zebpay? <SEP> Are you familiar with "Wallets"? <SEP> kind of stuff authorised and genuiune one? <SEP> is there something like shapeshift but with larger volumes? <SEP> yes wallets <SEP> Do you have a wallet for ethereum? <SEP> no i have one for bitcoin i.e zebpay <SEP> I'm unfamiliar with bitcoin. I am very familiar with ethereum. I will help you. <SEP> yes thanks for that i am more inclined for ethereum as of now <SEP> which wallet do you have for ethereum? <SEP> With Ethereum, you have a wallet. A wallet is similar to a bank account number. The wallet has a public "account address" and a private "account password", both are very long. You do not need to use a website for them. They are not saved on a website. <SEP> Every ethereum wallet is the same. The wallet is an address and a password. <SEP> ok so how one can get that wallet and more about that. <SEP> https://www.myetherwallet.com/ Use this website to create a (1) password,  (2) address, and (3) private-key... Save the password, address, and private key. Print it. Keep it somewhere safe. <SEP> Once you have the password, adress, and private-key -- you are done. You have a wallet / bank account. It is yours. No one in the world should ever know your password or private key. <SEP> how to buy etherereum from it then can we buy directly ethereum from our local currency  instead of converting bitcoin <SEP> Good question. <SEP> Here is what will happen <SEP> There are four things: (1) Your US dollars / other currency (you have) (2) Your ethereum wallet (you just made) (3) A website with an exchange (A place to buy ethereum for US dollars) (4) A wallet on the exchange <SEP> You need to create an  <SEP> ok
<SEP> Can someone explain what this soft fork does and also direct me to where someone from the foundation explains what is going on.  I am not seeing that anywhere. <SEP> @NG_Fourth_twitter https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/17/critical-update-re-dao-vulnerability/ and https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/dao-wars-youre-voice-soft-fork-dilemma/ <SEP> basically its up to the miners now <SEP> @Zoltu  It is not a contract, is a token <SEP> You can follow a pattern where any contract method that doesn't do anything with received Ether will automatically throw.  This will protect the contract's users from accidentally sending their ether to the void. <SEP> @picojoule I have read the Etherum Blogs. I read them as soon as I saw them come out over the past few days.  I guess my question is why is there not more information about this since it is such a HUGE issue. <SEP> @NG_Fourth_twitter is there any information in particular that you're interested in? theres been almost an overwhelming amount of discussion about it on reddit and here IMO <SEP> It is a huge issue, although more so for the DAO than for ethereum itself. It was a case of a smart contract written in a way that was insecure <SEP> @Zoltu  and then I can send ether to the dao? <SEP> @pat22rpc I think I may be misunderstanding what you want to do.  Can you explain exactly what your goal is?
<SEP> hello guys , <SEP> how we set timeline on sell and buy ERC20 token <SEP> I want to join the ICO. They want an ERC20 compatible wallet Can I join the ICO if I download the wallet on your site? <SEP> just use a wallet from myetherwallet, it's enough
<SEP> hello Michael <SEP> I have a problem with sync Ethereum Mist. First, after 10-15 mins of syncing it stopped and i had to restart it.  This carried on for couple of days and I reached 3.6 million. Then it stopped, i restarted it and then to my horror it started the sync right from the beginning... <SEP> Could you help me find out whats going on? <SEP> Several articles write about the priority of investment in dapps with not too much gas, by miners: I can understand the choice about highest fee in some dapp, but which advantages could have some miner avoiding an investment in dapps where have been instanced thousand or million of gas? Maybe that, is cause of too slow operations? <SEP> I install Ethereum wallet and after I shut it down I try to open it but it did not remember my password, now I have bitcoin in it but can not get access <SEP> is it lost for ever or is there some way I ca get it back <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87
<SEP> Is there a forum dedicated to announcing Ethereum based crowdsales?  Any help is appreciated. <SEP> I used the word :understand: and defined every word of each word used to define every word of each of those words, until I saw the word "thin " appear over and over throughout many different words ... <SEP> the word thing seemed to have infinite properties yet we use words everyday . thats when I realized there was a confusion within the mind that cant be seen unless someone really looks for it <SEP> language is the everyday way to communicate yet there are hidden barriers within that keeps people from understanding the forces, energies, properties and structures of a word in itself... sound is energy, people have the ability to create sound.  we harness the sound as words to interact but unless someone understands the story (one's intended use or meanings of words) then the words are either useless or brings life. <SEP> @VitalikButerin should see this lol
<SEP> Hey hello everyone <SEP> is here any support <SEP> @kayabaNerve not many, because smart contract devs are in extreme high demand atm and most people offering jobs don't have any idea what kind of money they have to pay for a skilled dev to build their ideas <SEP> @alisaeeeeeed_twitter yes <SEP> @raj86565_twitter just ask and see if anybody knows the answer <SEP> if you don't get an answer, paying a tip usually helps to motivate people to answer <SEP> Why etherium is not sending from erherblockchain to given wallet. <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x1F99f6036497769dAD66bd8b2Bde5820b9FDa9df <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x1F99f6036497769dAD66bd8b2Bde5820b9FDa9df <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x1F99f6036497769dAD66bd8b2Bde5820b9FDa9df <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x1F99f6036497769dAD66bd8b2Bde5820b9FDa9df <SEP> The fraud is back.

<SEP> @robipuha_twitter my node was synced but the chain keeps on growing so when your offline for a while you have sync the blocks that where mined during your offtime <SEP> @lukas-berlin Ha. So it means it's neverending story. All the time somebody will mine new blocks. So it means each time you will open Ethereum App it will require to synchronize. And if you are not there for few weeks -- it's the same story like I have now :) <SEP> My impression is, unless you are an eth miner, you dont need to be synced with all the blocks <SEP> In that case, you can start mist in light mode <SEP> @robipuha_twitter yes every ~15s theres a new block. Thats the blockchain, it keeps on growing until the last node shuts down.

<SEP> Hello from Brazil People. My company is working fowards Private Blockchain and they will make use of Ethereum. So they tell me: you need to find what is the solution for our needs in Infraestructure and Architecture to able the Development and deploy of an application, in a Private Blockchain with Ethereum, so they don't want minning fees and do not have a Cryptocurrency focused ecosystem...So I think this is not a problem because we can setup the Gas/Eth with Infinitum amount in the Wallets, at now we just want to deploy Smart Contracts. I try my best but I'm not able to figure out what should I use to make this Enviroment possible. Shoul'd I use Geth Client to create the Genesis Block and connect betwen the nodes? Is "just" it? When to use Ganache, Truffle, or even Parity? I have read something about. I need some direction here! I Would appreciate your help so much. Even guides or blog posts will be helpful. Thank you all! <SEP> Sorry my bad english,  I'm Learning it too! <SEP> Cheers! <SEP> So it's not possible to deploy smart contracts and have an certainly amount of validation and confiability? <SEP> I'm thinking in reformulate my question.

<SEP> Hey guys. I recently built a freelance platform like Fiverr/Freelancer/Upwork using ethereum. For all the beginners out here, I have written an entire blog post explaining how I developed the smart contract from scratch in Solidity v0.5.2!  It also covers how you can deploy and interact with the contract in Remix. This project will definitely help you learn and understand where and how you can apply blockchain and ethereum smart contracts in particular in your own personal projects!  Definitely check out my post here: https://www.roheat.com/ethereum-smart-contract-tutorial-build-a-freelance-platform/ <SEP> `cjd` That's really cool <SEP> `cjd` does it have any kind of rating / reputation ? <SEP> @matrixbot  no, rating system is not there. I could only cover the basic functionalities in the blog so that it's not too long to read :smile: <SEP> But if you go through the tutorial, you should be in a position to add that functionality yourself!

There is perhaps lag from the larger transaction size. Im not familiar with Gemini or Bittrex interfaces, so I dont know where to look for a list of transactions. Maybe double check that you actually sent it? Go back to your account and see if there is still ether in it. If not, go check the account you sent it to. If it doesnt show up in one account or the other within the next hour or so, its possible it was lost. Not sure how else that could occur other than if you simply typed in the wrong address to send your ether to.
<SEP> Hello. How is an ECR-20 transfer represented on the chain? Does it involve a transfer of 0 Ether _from_ the initiator _to_ the ECR-20 token contract, along with the appropriate data to initiate the call? <SEP> A sender and a receiver <SEP> Is it always the case that the contract is the receiver address in this case, and the user is the sender address? <SEP> Can you say whether the following is true or false? A user wants to execute a function which writes data on contract C. To do this, the user initiates a transfer of 0 Ether to contract C with appropriate function call payload data <SEP> A user wants to execute that function directly

I'm going to implement 'presale' for launching an NFT Game, but I don't have much knowledge about this. Could you teach me the process? Thanks in advance. <SEP> We are inviting developers, designers and entrepreneurs across the globe to participate in the first Bitcoin Bankathon to solve real-world problems by conceptualizing and building financial applications on Web3.  The hackathon lasts from November 19th till December 8th and contains prizes worth of 150,000 USD. Participation is possible online or on-site in El Salvador.  Building on RSK, any language that compiles to the EVM is supported. This includes Solidity, Julia, and new or experimental programming languages such as Vyper.  Website: https://bitcoin-alliance.org/en/ Discord: https://discord.gg/Ryh7tuMUnf <SEP> Hey <SEP> ETH,ETH <SEP> ETH is already pulling up, and friends with ETH can take a break for a while <SEP> Here's a fun thought experiment I'm working on: How would I go about recreating the Philosopher's Stone as an NFT? Consider that the Philosopher's Stone, like the one in Harry Potter, must be able to create news instances of an NFT called "Elixir of Life", and that it must also be able to "transmute" existing NFTs of type "base_metal" to a mapped equivalent "precious_metal".  Surely the ERC721 standard itself can't handle this even with modification; wouldn't this require an abstract contract that holds definitions for all the types of NFTs I've just described and handles permissions for the PS to create or alter its other held NFTs?  Does such a contract exist in practice right now? Anyone out there playing with scriptable NFTs like this? <SEP> @Halil_incekaraa_twitter <SEP> You can find here. https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/ <SEP> #DYNOGE stealthlaunch on Pancakeswap  <SEP> Hello , i had financial problems so i tried to find help in darkweb , i found a serious guy i gave 350 usd and i received 1500 usd moneygram transfert his contact telegram @DevFR22 <SEP> haha <SEP> Who want triple his wallet btc ot eth send message telegram @DevFR22 <SEP> Only the greedy will fall victim of this low life scam... <SEP> Who want credit cards available , hack email , insta , whatsap ...

<SEP> Hello <SEP> i finished developping my e-wallet , how to connect it or to link it  to a trading platform ? <SEP> @YOUKEYKO If you have `developed` your own `e-wallet`, you can use `API` call supported by a trading platform. <SEP> @maqiutian Take note of the announcement on top of the page.  <SEP> @yangyangxing If you run a private-net test, the default will reset. If you need to re-use your chain, route your interface to the DB folder. Read this for some ideas @ https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/39922/ethereum-private-chain-resets-back-to-block-0-when-restarted <SEP> Hi Guys,  A question bugging me, How come some Smart Contract ICOs can accept Bitcoins, Litecoins and even fiat currency? Well, as far as I know Smart Contracts can only accept Ethers.  Is there any code I'm missing ? <SEP> @reoxey In principal, Ethereum can't interact `directly` with other blockchains. Suggest reading would be; * Comparison of hash & protocols used by respective blockchains platforms @ https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/  However, there is Ethereum `BTC-Relay` that was build for such purpose. Read; @ https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay @ http://btcrelay.org/ @ Ethereum Contract for Bitcoin SPV: `Live at` https://etherscan.io/address/0x41f274c0023f83391de4e0733c609df5a124c3d4 <SEP> @yangyangxing :+1: :smile: <SEP> Hi Guys, i want to create an erc20 token, How can i reduce to almost 0 the transaction fees? <SEP> @danae12 around 2 million euros <SEP> mobile.mela36@gmail.com <SEP> Is oraclize not working on Rinkeby? <SEP> @danae12 There is no possible way to answer that question. You need a lawyer who keeps banks in conformance to regulations. Those are the only people who could begin to guess the answer <SEP> @danae12 If you can figure out who is paying the bills for Itbit, how much they invested, then multiply that by the number of brick and mortar branches the bank owns. That would probably be the starting minimum. <SEP> @danae12 And if the regulators can find just one claim that is a violation of "Consumer Protections" then the whole bank would be eaten by the government in fines. Who wants that liability? Look at gun manufacturers and how they go out of business with lawsuits for school shootings! The same would happen to banks using crypto. No bank would willfully participate with money laundering. And that is what cryptos are. <SEP> @danae12 Maybe your school project should look at something on a smaller scale. How much would it cost you personally if you installed a bitcoin ATM that pays out real money cash for bitcoin? And then you keep the ATM open to the public and you keep the ATM filled with cash at all times during the worst week of bitcoin price crashes so far this calendar year. How much real money would you have lost buying crashing bitcoins? The answer to that question would put the premise of financial institutions installing any crypto, it would put the premise  into a more realistic perspective. <SEP>  @julientregoat yes , I just extend standardtoken .  So the contract has no fallback function <SEP> @danae12 Just sharing 2 cents thoughts & pointers; * Firstly, define what you meant by financial institutions - banks, investments, exchanges/brokerage, insurances? And, which is your reference of case-study? * Is it going to be a new or existing outfit? * Are they going to be public or private? * Are they going to be B2B, B2C or thru middle-entity/man? ex; exhanges/brokerages would have to deal with multiple parties * Take a research on the country of origin that you're in (or your study-case) * Many countries have Central-Banks that regulates the financial sectors (ex; be it banks, financial, investments, insurances, etc) * Big-ticket item starts from the so-called financial capability/readiness (ex; to establish a bank, one may need minimum CAPEX of $2Billion - figures depend on which countries, could be slightly lower for small-ticket items) * How about cost-recovery factor? Some countries allow for cost-recovery if such institution is directly associated with the regulators/governments - thus lowering their financial exposures * Where will they have their operations (US, China, India - or other cost competitive markets; if they are not regulated domestically in country of origin)? * All the above would have different economics/cost-models; hence the figures would differ among each-other * Once you zoom-into such pointers/variables, your iterations would resulted in different economics (NPVs, IRRs, ROIs). * Your average would then need to conclude/compare the different types of financial institution `categories` when it comes to implementation of blockchain-tech (and its eco-systems) - be it BTC, ETH, XLM, NEO, etc.  :information_source: Hence, it would be too generic to conclude an `average` if the variables are inconclusive. You may PM me if you need ideas - I'm OK for `school/study-related` matters.

<SEP> hey <SEP> someone here? <SEP> i come from south Korea <SEP> H <SEP> Hi all - is this the right place for a general Ethereum architecture question? <SEP> Whats the question <SEP> Thanks! If I wanted to create an instance of Ethereum with tweaks to the native token, how would I do it? <SEP> I'm researching the ability to make a chain with a stablecoin as its native token. <SEP> If we'd like to work with a 1 token released for every dollar deposited, we'd need the ability to both mint and burn tokens. <SEP> I'm confused as to what parts of the codebase would need to be modified for such a thing. <SEP> @wschwab you want to build an own instance of the Ethereum network? or just print a token? <SEP> i cant see any big amount there <SEP> https://etherscan.io/token/0xcbeabd17c4545e6ae5a3b40d49c8c1b896688d85?a=0xdaec7a4301e6fa19b7b092bd625167a48f9c3243 <SEP> You can share some to me, if you are glad  :) <SEP> What is the difference between using poa main network or ethereum main network..

<SEP> hi <SEP> ethereum wallet not syncing <SEP> do you have an error or just not waiting long enough? <SEP> whats wallet address? <SEP> Any replacement for AlethZero? It looks awesome on videos but seems to be discontinued. SOlidity has much less features for debugging <SEP> hi there <SEP> wanted to ask a question <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter You would likely have to file with the SEC or similar organizations if youre in a different country. <SEP> GoodEvening guys, I am trying to install a new node ethereum on my pc with OS linux debian9 but when i launch the command "sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum" it finish with an error message "gpg: no valid OpenPGP data found"... can someone help me with this issue? <SEP> @kdenhartog  I'm in Canada, I'm not sure if going through the SEC process is worth it, so if it's not share then I don't have to file with SEC <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter Since theyre still writing the framework for this system its hard to say, but if you intend to raise capital through means of sharing equity and intend to sell to US citizens then you will have to file with them. Even if you do not plan to sell in the US, it is a good idea to file with Canada's regulatory body. The wildwest show of raising capital through ICOs will inevitably result in future headaches for those who didnt file previously. Although these regulatory bodies are slow, they eventually do get to addressing these concerns, so its best to work with them than to try to skirt them. <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter I'm Canadian.  Depends who you want to sell it to. <SEP> @kdenhartog Thanks Kyle, that make sense! <SEP> @BrianErdelyi_twitter  Brain could you please explain ? I was thinking to do it like crowd-equity fundraising , not to specific group or people <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter if the token represents an equity (as you've described), it is fair to say that selling the token has to see the same regulatory requirements.  If you sell Canadian equities you must follow IROC requirements. <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter SEC also regulates the sale of equities to US citizens <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter the regulations involve know your client (KYC) requirements. <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter are shares of your company already traded on an exchange?  Or are you planning a private placement? <SEP> @ahmedmugtaba_twitter are you planning to sell to Canadians, Americans, anonymous people, criminals, terrorists? <SEP> is it ethtrade.org under your program sir... ? sorry i am  a bit confuse here...

Talk about what's different? <SEP> It allows to mint, freeze, and other options not available to regular coin. <SEP> I am looking for someone that has deployed this type of contract please... <SEP> Minting and freezing are relatively common features. <SEP> Hove you deployed this type of contract? <SEP> @AgreCoin_twitter One of mine on mainnet https://etherscan.io/address/0xc1e5fc5b761e82174a3c23ec5b21887c9510c7ab, it can mint, burn. I did not need to freeze, so I did not add that, but I can upgrade it anytime I want. <SEP> @AgreCoin_twitter Another one https://etherscan.io/token/0x68c9139805bc945caa12bfd70ff568b5248afd1e <SEP> How much ether did it require, I read this: <SEP> @AgreCoin_twitter Let me know if you want to discuss "other options" that supposedly are not available to other tokens. <SEP> What? <SEP> Are you saying this? Or you read it somewhere? <SEP> It sounds insane. <SEP> It pertains to the new full code <SEP> I have to go now, have a meeting later.  Let me know later if you have a real serious project. <SEP> @AgreCoin_twitter This is a token I did for a British company. https://etherscan.io/token/0x1dbed266d20d27d0bd1c4707fc002defe7e0267b <SEP> @AgreCoin_twitter Kindly contact officiallives1@gmail.com for your rectification <SEP> @BLOCKCHAINFAC_twitter stop scamming <SEP> @  Kindly contact officiallives1@gmail.com for your rectification <SEP> @cwong112020_twitter he is a scammer, just trying to get your private key <SEP> 0x908bC24c7fAd5b870f2936D9425383F8eA9c80db may belong to @BLOCKCHAINFAC_twitter . You should ask him <SEP> @cwong112020_twitter if your coins are gone, nobody will be able to recover it <SEP> yes, he is a known spammer and scammer here <SEP> there is no official central instance of Ethereum, you can't rollback transactions <SEP> find out how you fucked up, learn from that, only advice anybody can give you <SEP> @sh4d0v1 Yes, you arae right about him as he asked me for my 12 word passphrase. Well, I have no idea how my token were taken from my wallet as I did not change anything or gave out my pass phrase or private key?? <SEP> maybe you got phished by a fake MEW website <SEP> there was a case of DNS-spoofing MEW a few weeks ago <SEP> Get some anti-malware and scan your machine for key-loggers. <SEP> Yeah, I know about that and I  was very careful. So there is no way I could recover my token? <SEP> what kind of operation system do you use? <SEP> hope it is not Windows XP or something <SEP> so might have been malware on your computer, might have been a malicious website... <SEP> if they have your key, they can move all tokens chances are they just didn't notice these tokens as valuable and not some worthless spam tokens <SEP> move them to a new wallet as so as possible

Is that the only saving grace of Smart Contracts? <SEP> Also do you have to pay gas each time you deploy a DAPP and if so does that mean you have to pay gas for updates as well?

<SEP> hi <SEP> Hello everyone!! Probably it was already explained before in the chat but I'd appreciate if someone could do this again. I already have a business plan (white paper) and I'd like to start an ICO. How should I procedure with it now after I have done my white paper?? <SEP> @davi578 Ok, you have a white paper. Now you need around $25K to hire a Solidity developer (or learn the stuff yourself in 6-12 months) to write secure contracts. You'll also need $20K-$25K for an audit. Maybe $5K+ for an investor intake portal. $30K+ for marketing. <SEP> I imagine that's chump change if you fleece it off the public. <SEP> @phalexo you are forgetting about the legal staff, costly specialists too <SEP> @dlrusinek Before you can "fleece" the public, using your terminology, you have to have the monies in hand to pay all the professionals. How is that different from any other investments that go through registered brokers, who take the lion's share, to promote any company's offering? <SEP> hi all. Is it possible to freeze a ECR20 tocken ? <SEP> @asiniscalchi If you built this functionality into the token then of course. If not, then no. <SEP> @phalexo in the second opition, may I create a smartContract to send the tockens to ? <SEP> a kind of an account  able only to receive <SEP> To do what? To make them unavailable?  For how long? <SEP> for ever <SEP> Just send to address 0x0, done. Or 0x1, or 0x2, etc... <SEP> @phalexo I am looking to the possibility to move ERC20 tockens to other blockchains. In that sense I'd like to have the tocken's owners to be able to manage their tockens till the day of the freeze <SEP> @phalexo sending to null waller makes the tockens unavailables sinse the transfer <SEP> Again, you only have the functionality that you have built into the token. Was that a question? <SEP> If you have not built what's needed to burn tokens, then your token holders should send their balances to your address in exchange for tokens on another chain. <SEP> yes <SEP> Sending a balance to any address for which there is NO known  private key, makes it forever unavailable for further transfers. <SEP> @phalexo that's the  idea. Thanks. <SEP> I think POA is doing this very thing. Maybe you could get some ideas there. <SEP> @greggirwin  thanks. I will <SEP> Is it possible to remove the ECR20::approve after an account run it ? <SEP> @asiniscalchi Run approve again with 0. <SEP> @phalexo 0x0 <SEP> @kayabaNerve  Interesting .. and how could I get all the approvals of an account ? <SEP> In my case I'd like to get all the approvals of an account and set them all to 0 <SEP> Event history <SEP> @kayabaNerve  got it <SEP> I think it will be costly to execute such an task
<SEP> Bjdjd <SEP> Hola <SEP> Did anyone read my post and can I get an answer please <SEP> Hello I am new to crypto and have a question about wallets and exchanges. If I sent EHT from bitstamp exchange  to cryptopia exchange and then I found out that cyrptopia does not accept ETH from bitstamp because bitstamp uses contracts which I was told are internal...what ever that means. Yet when I check Ether blockchain explorer it says sent successful. Bitstamp says it sent but cryptopia says they cant accept it. So where is my ETH and how do I get it back? <SEP> @sh4d0v1  You seem to be know what your talking about can you tell me if there is a way to get my coins back? <SEP> @jayzyme_twitter if the transaction from bitstamp was successfully mined into the chain the coins are at cryptopia you made a classic newbie mistake to try to send ETH between exchanges directly <SEP> can I get them back <SEP> talk to their support, they will have to credit your ETH by hand <SEP> So it is possible they can give them back <SEP> you just made them work by not using their automatisms correctly <SEP> they have it, they probably will give it back after some time <SEP> can take month <SEP> Im not sure what you are saying but is it that they now have to do it by hand and it will take time? <SEP> yes <SEP> Thank you very much i appreciate your tiem <SEP> time <SEP> Why does it take SO LONG to get my wallet to sync? I've been trying for over a week with no luck! It keeps getting stuck, only DL'ing maybe 1,000 blocks before I have to restart it! <SEP> I've left it on for several days straight but it won't DL more than 1,000 to 2,000 blocks before freezing. <SEP> Hi guys, please tell me if will be a fork on 19th of the ETH? I read about this and I saw one website http://etherzero.org/index.html that sell ETHZERO. Is a scam? <SEP> @Chris46319_twitter that is a real problem, the network is congested again <SEP> you could try the Parity wallet, it syncs much faster <SEP> @madalinavram85 there are forks all the time, don't spend your money on something you don't understand <SEP> if you want to buy a ETH fork then buy Ethereum Classic (ETC) <SEP> I've already got ETH waiting to get into this wallet. I'm at 4.1M and I need to get to 4.8M All my connections are good. Plenty of available bandwidth. I've even stopped mining just so I can open up more bandwidth. The thing is, it shouldn't just stop. I get the congestion and all. Still, no excuse for just stopping altogether. <SEP> It is very bad, ETH isn't really scalable <SEP> Contact our blockchain technical support for anybody who's having  problem with their transaction  ltrh1508@gmail.com <SEP> stop scamming  @EthereumBTC_twitter
<SEP> hello people <SEP> almost <SEP> i have to wait for a phone to be able to verify my wallet <SEP> @glass_is0_twitter This is a website that you use to track the price of Ethereum. It's not an actual buy/sell site for the ethereum itself. <SEP> ordered a cell today <SEP> The credits are used up when 'trigger points' are hit. So if you set a trigger point for $400, and it hits that point, one credit is used. <SEP> However, I'm going to be writing a blog post on my website strikingtan.com on how to buy ethereum. Stay tuned and check back daily, and remember to subscribe. <SEP> it gave me the option for 5.99 a share <SEP> probably taken <SEP> where is your wallet? <SEP> it was legit for awhile <SEP> BUT <SEP> the 1st & only time i tried to use it <SEP> someone stole the key code to the manycam purchase i was trying to make <SEP> so, i just put it out of my mind <SEP> now with the price surging <SEP> i'm really curious <SEP> i utilized this site for something related https://stripe.com/checkout <SEP> i'm in process with coinbase.com
<SEP> Hi guys. Can someone tell me if it's possible to mine with gtx 950 with 2 GB vram? I know that the DAG file is making problems due to it size, but is there a way to overcome it? <SEP> @andrejbog 1) 2GB is too small 2) You would spend more in electricity than get in ether from that card. <SEP> Thanks for the fast respond, bud. However, I am just experimenting and I live in a country in which electricity costs less than 4 cents per kW/H. I just want to know if there is any way of overcoming the DAT file size problem. Or should I just wait and save some money for some better graphic card?
<SEP> hey, does anyone have a tip to fully sync my mist or ethereum wallet? i got some ether stored on my keystore but i cant fully load it <SEP> @LeonMak5_twitter Is your wallet using geth? If so, I have been trying for months and can't figure it out. I think everybody is in the same boat with you <SEP> would pay 50 euros to the guy who could open it for me <SEP> think i skipped the password option <SEP> which the wallet is my only option <SEP> is there any working wallet system that only requires the keystore? <SEP> and ethereum doesnt rekon the problem? <SEP> im HODL'ing since april 2017 and not actually planning on selling anytime soon, if theyre close to a solution thats okay too <SEP> sounds like a good plan <SEP> I let it run even though it never will catch up and finish the last two hundred block. So I at least have a copy of the database.
<SEP> @AyushyaChitransh Almost one year. Nothing has ever expired yet. So nobody knows the answers to my questions <SEP> I used MEW. It didn't require that. If you know smart contracts, maybe you can find the original developer contract. This might be good for your business, too. But I think developers are letting this be a known problem in the future intentionally <SEP> the entire blockchain has not downloaded yet on my OS, is that the problem? <SEP> @amirparv Check your address at etherscan. <SEP> Good luck downloading your wallet.

<SEP> anyone here from Romania, that can help out with Coinbase? <SEP> sorry, meant shism <SEP> well <SEP> i dont see it as a sin <SEP> i look at is great <SEP> or any ideas regarding Coinbase and their error on the ID verification country_not found <SEP> i thought purpose of ether was to make software updates more seamless, through voting, <SEP> since bitcoin sucks at updating softwrae, <SEP> i would think hard forks would be great <SEP> allows software for these cryptocurrencies to get updated <SEP> no ethereum is a new generation after bitcoin <SEP> well <SEP> read http://ethdocs.org for more information <SEP> i think it also has something like Bip66 was for bitcoin <SEP> i see the purpose of using it over bitcoin is that it allows software updates to get voted on <SEP> i dont really care about everything else it offers <SEP> miners shoul most likely flag them after consistency checks <SEP> to me if bitcoin could just edit the code through ether voting process to make block size bigger it wouldnt have problems <SEP> with bigger block size you can expose the infrastructure to anomalize <SEP> it has to grow organically at a 10-15% pace <SEP> at a reasonable size, like UAC environments are sized, compared to production <SEP> i c <SEP> otherwise, you get a massive roleback cost <SEP> what would be interesting, is to give the miner the ability to participate in beta deployments <SEP> and actually give feedback <SEP> after the voting is done in the pilot area, then another chunk of 15% can be deployed, after 2 weeks <SEP> i'm mainly interesested in anything that allows the cryptocurrency software to update based on consesnsus voting, make voting mandatory with nodes <SEP> and keep it in a 2 week pace of 15% <SEP> and it seems like ether allows that better than bitcoin <SEP> thus generating a 2 week window for rollback contingency plans <SEP> then check out BiP66 from bitcoin <SEP> ive heard of it <SEP> its a signaling thing <SEP> the miners code was updated, and as packets were propagated by the miner, they were checked based on the consensus rules <SEP> it brands the packets, more or less :) <SEP> any idea regarding wallets that are ok for middle-east Europe? <SEP> I'm having some trouble with coinbase at the time <SEP> gas * gasPrice

<SEP> Hi <SEP> the most trusted software is: https://www.myetherwallet.com <SEP> Hi guys is it safe to download Eth wallet to conputer and leave the wallet  to your computer? <SEP> Security experts would recommend being very careful with your private keys. <SEP> Send them to no one and only store them safely. <SEP> @Johaneschen Hi there, I uploaded an ether address which I took from my last ether transfer report file. it could be uploaded as contract but not as wallet, and the belance is not showing. I had a blockchain.info accoutn and i dont have the password and passphrase, but I have the backupof the last transaction report in excel file. is there away for me to move my ether which is stuck within blockchain to other address? <SEP> Is there any way to use my ether transport file to export my ether out of blockchain, or to import my ethers to myethereumwallet? <SEP> You can contact us for any unconfirmed transaction for BLOCKCHAIN users only , please connect with us here by sending your transaction ID through direct message. or ltrh1508@gmail.com <SEP> @etherenvoy_twitter  I sent coins to the address wallet of the Ethereum Wallet.I do not see them because synchronization is very slow.I have an account on MyEtheriumWallet.How can I see my coins on MyEtheriumWallet from the Etherium Wallet adress? <SEP> @EthereumBTC_twitter stop scamming! <SEP> Don't send any data to Luis Souza  (@EthereumBTC_twitter ) he is trying to scam you <SEP> how do i start ? <SEP> Start what exactly? <SEP> Can anyone help with eth wallet sync issues? looking to create a new token on eth platform, but stuck forever <SEP> @Enkiridion You can use https://wallet.ethereum.org/ <SEP> Thanks, is it an online version of the wallet app? <SEP> It _IS_ the wallet app. Neither of these are offline. <SEP> quite confusing, this does progress with sync but doesn't show how much to go, my account or options to create one, to send stuff, etc. The downloadable one gets stuck on looking for peers eternally <SEP> Enkiridion, I'd like to help you solve your problem entirely. <SEP> If and when you're available, lets fix your problem in real time. <SEP> lovely, thanks for your availability. I do have accounts on the downloadable app - I just can't use them because I'm not synched.

Is there anyone in here willing to spend a few minutes talking me through my problem. I would very much appreciate someones help <SEP> whats your problem? <SEP> I bought EOS and I am following the instructions for EOS token sale. I have a qty of ETHER stored in my ETHER account, that I purchased through the EOS token distribution sale. Is this the value now associated wit hte EOS tokens that I purchased . Its all very confusing <SEP> you will get the tokens automatically on the wallet you have send your ETH from <SEP> which wallet do you use <SEP> i am quite sure you will find in the EOS FAQ the exact information about the token address you need to watch <SEP> @sh4d0v1   thank you for that help <SEP> I set up a MetaMask Wallet <SEP> @ek_keane1_twitter you need to watch the eos token contract address to see if you have some <SEP> @lancewellspring make the most of your time, build something yourself <SEP> think of the cryptokitten guy <SEP> he is selling virtual kitties for millions <SEP> @ek_keane1_twitter the tokens are never really _on_ your software wallet, they are always just data in the blockchain which everybody shares <SEP> @sh4d0v1 is correct. The programs you use are really just helping you see whats on the blockchain and interact with it. These programs do not contain your coins -- the ethereum network's blockchain does. You're free to use your address and key on a different wallet software, provided it is reputable and trusted.
<SEP> hi yall , Ive been synching nodes for days, finally completed then the whole thing started again. Finally this message came up on my Terminal: You're one of the lucky few that will try out the JIT VM (random).

You can switch to the regular VM by setting --jitvm=false <SEP>  @bobbykennedy what does this mean and am i really supposed to report this? <SEP> @ekkis wow, Im having the same issue. this is like day 7 of messing with this. starting to wonder if its worth it
<SEP> Hey guys <SEP> Is it possible to password-protect one's Ethereum wallet? <SEP> Hey there how long does it take to get my  wallet synced? I see 3 peers, 2 937 121 outstanding blocks, and 0% downloaded, and that for hours. <SEP> `Quiark` Seph Fontane Pennock, in Mist/geth there is a password by default <SEP> I downloaded the regular Ethereum Wallet <SEP> If I open it from my desktop, I don't need to fill out a password or anything <SEP> `Quiark` Seph Fontane Pennock, I don't use it but... maybe it'll ask before using the wallet (sending coins)? <SEP> Hi is it somehow possible to restore my keystore folder on windows?
<SEP> it looks like all the different smart contract languages are "compiled" into bytecode that is then executed by the EVM - is that correct? <SEP> @JustusMoeller  yes thats correct <SEP> whats the instruction set of the EVM? if I wanted to write my own language, how would I go about figuring out how the EVM works? <SEP> @JustusMoeller  look into the yellowpaper, every OPcode is descibed there https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf <SEP> thanks <SEP> @KeenanTR  do you have parity or another geth instance running? You cant run two clients on the same port.  can you post the result of  ```ps -ax | grep geth``` <SEP> @lukas-berlin I was running Ethereum Wallet, Mist, and Parity simultaneously. <SEP> @KeenanTR  ok pick one and you should be fine <SEP> @lukas-berlin Nevermind. It's giving me the same error.

I can't connect to Parity nor Mist. I think a better way to frame my question is as follows: How do I initiate the "--unlock

<SEP> hello <SEP> Hi. I'm a software consultant and I'm building a social application that I will open-source and I was planning on using Spring Boot and Angular. I now think I want to use Ethereum. Can someone suggest a link for reading that discusses use of the framework or software for building dapps? I love the concept and I'm quite sure that this is where I need to be. I love the privacy aspect and I'm wondering if all my data can be block-chained? <SEP> the blockchain is pretty expensive if you try to use it as a database <SEP> for much more than minimal data <SEP> the main framework I know of for building dapps is truffle <SEP> Disregard my ignorance, I just found http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ <SEP> http://truffleframework.com/ <SEP> ah, cool. Thanks. Isn't work fun and not work? :-) Don't tell anyone, we might get fired. <SEP> So, do we have profit takers selling before the weekend again this week?

I tried a couple homebrew builds of ethminer but always caught a snag.

<SEP> Hi Everyone! <SEP> Checkout: https://shopawl.com It accepts Bitcoin and Ethereum for online shopping! <SEP> Are their designated moderators in this channel?  Folks who can finally put a halt to the off-topic political debate about fork purity, ETH vs. ETC, advertising for one or the other, and adspam about shopping that works with digital assets?  Seriously, I'm still fairly new to gitter, and would like to better understand what the governance is for keeping the communication channel effective and narrowly scoped to its purpose. <SEP> @A2be You can see the activity on the right and people do get banned.  Unfortunately, getting a new account to login to Gitter with is pretty easy so banning has limited effectiveness. <SEP> Would be nice if admins could delete messages from banned users, that would make it so the banned people had less of a negative impact on the overall chat stream, could be a good suggestion for Gitter.im. <SEP> where is the ETC ether DAO ????? <SEP> Lol. Nice trolling! :trollface: <SEP> Thanks for the answer @Zoltu .  The "activity" on the right also answers my other question about who can/does moderate this chat channel.  Appears to be @alexvandesande and @obscuren who monitor for such abuse of the chat. <SEP> Agree with Tim Schuster @tscs37 : the market of a traded and liquid asset is a much better indicator of value than a few-day snapshot of xaction volume, especially during a period where large volumes of the non-forked-chain token are being liquidated by holders of forked-chain asset.  Also, it is correct that use of ether for contracts on Ethereum is far more important to the ecosystem than is token volume on exchanges. <SEP> @A2be Lets not revitalize that conversation here in the Welcome channel.
<SEP> @NilgorenNil_twitter Hello <SEP> Hello guys, can you please tell me why when i run ethereum wallet or mist my pc starts freezing so bad? And can i see my balance updated without downloading all blocks? <SEP> Is that possible to change blocks downloading directroy at all? i scared i have not enough disk space in current partition:D <SEP> @YangLiuDr_twitter @tamim2996 there cannot be a third party verification, thr main feature would be compromised, decentralization <SEP> GitLab just acquired gitter <SEP> http://blog.gitter.im/2017/03/15/gitter-gitlab-acquisition/ <SEP> They're going to open source it :D <SEP> @AmirAfendin you dont have to wait to sync completely, you can just skip and access your wallet in Mist / Ethereum Wallet <SEP> @AmirAfendin but you may not see your balance updated until you sync upto the block that contained your latest balance <SEP> @AmirAfendin to change the download directory you can try using a symbolic link <SEP> @picojoule 1) how to skip it? 2)how to change symlink? Thanks for answers <SEP> @AmirAfendin you should see "Launch Application" <SEP> which will take you to your wallet while it continues to sync in the background <SEP> For the symlink are you on windows or mac? <SEP> if youre on mac or linux the command is ln -s
<SEP> does anyone know what framework the ethereum site uses? <SEP> How does one buy this ethereum wallet or digital currency?.i am in S <SEP> I am in Zimbabwe <SEP> Hey, where does the Mac version of the ethereum software install all the downloaded blocks? I've deleted the app from applications but the space on my hard drive hasn't freed up yet. <SEP> how do i Invest in the coin stuff <SEP> @razzzobistro Talk to the people who host the wallet you use. Perhaps they can reverse the trade. <SEP> @Lorddead123 A mining pool is typically the best bet when you're on your own with a low hash rate. <SEP> @chanaiwa_don_twitter @Zippydoo Please see the following exchanges. You can make accounts there and start buying ether.   https://www.coinbase.com/join/579e90fb23b4c120072869ea <SEP> @icecreamcomplex_twitter Please check the documentation of your software for that. <SEP> So with that, you could make around $35/month running 24/7 <SEP> Etherminer will tell you your effective hashrate after mining for about 30 minutes. <SEP> ok <SEP> Just search your wallet address after you've mined for a bit. <SEP> Keep in mind your ui on your comp will lag heavily because your gpu is being 100% used. <SEP> hello.. I am new to Ethereum, and just now I mistakenly sent from ETC to ETH wallet <SEP> Yep I understand haha <SEP> where would one search for their wallet address? <SEP> ETC is using jaxx, and ETH is using Parity. I looked up that it is possible to generate new wallet on ETC using the ETH's private key <SEP> are there any link on how is this done? <SEP> basically I am not able to find the private key generated using Parity <SEP> @razzzobistro no worries. Buy me a pizza if you're feeling generous by sending to the address i posted earlier :)
<SEP> Hi <SEP> @DrVikTroll hi <SEP> Is there an official, trusted, android wallet of Ethereum? <SEP> I found compatible ones but how could I trust third party apps? <SEP> @DrVikTroll yeah there is <SEP> @DrVikTroll check your private message.. i sent you info <SEP> thanks <SEP> So this did not help me. Anyone else has info about an OFFICIAL Ethereum wallet? <SEP> @DrVikTroll official android wallet don't exist. <SEP> 5000 szabo = $0.08(8 cents), so smart-contracts is very expensive, if your DApp is non-profit and have hundreds of thousands transactions. Is there a solution which does not require such expense? <SEP> have your users pay for it? <SEP> ethereum has a cost to use, that is not going away <SEP> only way is to shift the cost to end users <SEP> if your non profit cant pay for it <SEP> Yeah, no matter what, you'll have to pay for the transaction <SEP> Either that or have a fund created to support your non-profit <SEP> Like a DAO for your non-profit to fund the transactions <SEP> clear, thanks <SEP> ethereum has a cost to use, that is not going away  but it is possible if there is a transition to Proof of Stake? <SEP> No, Proof of Stake will still have a cost associated to it <SEP> Instead of paying people to donate computational power, you're paying people to keep their Ethereum on the Network <SEP> After POS, they may lower the cost of ETH transactions, but there will still be a cost <SEP> If there was no reason for miners to keep nodes running on the network, then the network falls apart <SEP> note that you can always run your own private ethereum network where there are no tranasction fees <SEP> but then you have to pay for that... <SEP> e.g. servers, storage, network, power, etc <SEP> and you aren't connected to the rest of the world <SEP> People seem to have problems with Ethereum Wallet <SEP> MEW also supports hardware wallets if you want the higher security <SEP> what are you referring to? <SEP> about the "difficulty number" in the block header <SEP> oh in a mined block/

Now how do i physically get them to a wallet? <SEP> and now, i can see the transaction appear on my wallet. Awesome! <SEP> @AIlancheran_twitter ERC20 tokens aren't stored in wallets. In fact, tokens only exist only balance values stored inside their smart contracts. <SEP> @nourharidy found a log, I will attempt to kill again, but tell me briefly, what is transaction_value in regards to the kill function? <SEP> Your smart contract stores information connecting your address to your balance <SEP> @Mbembem I'm not sure, give me a minute to check <SEP> @nourharidy No sweat <SEP> @Mbembem So sorry about this <SEP> I got caught in a conversation in ethereum/swarm <SEP> the transaction value is the address to send all Ethers to (your address) <SEP> If you haven't been using this parameter before, this might have been why you haven't received your Ethers yet <SEP> @nourharidy will that mean i will be able to put them on an exchange if needed? Will i be able to send it from my MIST address then? <SEP> @AIlancheran_twitter Yes, tokens are only numbers managed by smart contract functions. You tell the contract to send them and the contract only has to allocate them under the recipient's address. It's beautiful, I think :) <SEP> Hey guys. I am new to mist. I have already synced the blocks and im left with around 700k blocks. Can i open Mist in --fast mode without losing my progress? <SEP> @ierosvin  no --fast only works when you start from scratch <SEP> Thanks @lukas-berlin. Also i just found out that my underlying geth has fast and light modes deprecated. What to do? <SEP> which geth do you have? since 1.6 --light is renamen --syncmode=light <SEP> or --syncmode=fast but I think the old flags still work. <SEP> I am using  1.6. Yes, i see the --syncmode option. So to run mist in fast mode is this correct: mist --node-syncmode "fast" <SEP> mist is in fast mode by default but fast only works if your chaindata is empty. you can kill chaindata (or back it up) and try mist --syncmode=fast or just use mist --syncmode=light <SEP> sorry that was wrong ether kill chaindata and start mist or start mist with --node-syncmode=light. fast is the default. I often start the geth seperatly with console so you see what geth is doing. mist then automaticly connects to the running geth

<SEP> hi everyone! <SEP> Im new to cryptocurrencies...yeah had alot of other stuff going on..well but now im here and i would like to buy ether. <SEP> I downloaded the etherwallet and thougt i simply can deposit from my account and buy ether. But unfortunenatlly i cant. Is there any help? <SEP> the ether wallet seem to suck all out of my MacBook :( <SEP> have version 0.8.10 <SEP> go to coinbase <SEP> @SilverSurfer17 coinbase is the easiest way to get BTC, ETH, and LTC from your USD in my opinion <SEP> yep <SEP> its how non-technical people get their cryptos <SEP> oh ok <SEP> thx for the info <SEP> I should get a reward from them <SEP> for all the people I send over there <SEP> is coinbase also working in europe with  <SEP> can i give your name in and you get a reward? I would that ofcourse <SEP> @SilverSurfer17 I believe they take Euros <SEP> it shows the exchange rate for BTC/EURO <SEP> GDAX, their trading platform shows USD, EUR, GBP <SEP> how much ether does a transaction costs between two ethereum wallets? <SEP> @SilverSurfer17 https://www.coinbase.com/join/529a72c1d36b0d660500043b <SEP> 21000 gas <SEP> yeah they take euros <SEP> still complicated veryfing everything..from EU takes 3-5 days for a deposit...its like a joke. ethereum is set up for quick transactions and if i want to buy some it needs a week...hahaha <SEP> lol <SEP> This market is so quiet these past few days. Crypto's getting boring <SEP> its not ethereums fault <SEP> its your european money <SEP> once you have bitcoin or ethereum, you can send it around as fast as you like
<SEP> Hey guys <SEP> I am still waiting for my new libertyx store to open and have no access to btc.  Do you know a cheap btc exchange <SEP> kraken <SEP> Thank you <SEP> poloniex ? <SEP> or you trolling for panic sellers <SEP> kraken? <SEP> Okay Ill check em out <SEP> naw <SEP> you dont like kraken? <SEP> I am trying to get coin to resell on paxful <SEP> @roninkaizen I believe in that we, the people, should have the right over our money. I don't believe in banks, but I believe in the community. I could detail it further, but that's the overall answer on your 'Q' there. <SEP> engaging has to to do with responsibility, therefore it is a certain way of showing  by using ethereum <SEP> thinking, what kind of contracts are possible <SEP> So would it make sense, to invest in Ethereum - from your point of view? <SEP> absolutely <SEP> i am <SEP> lead by kant <SEP> that was pretty wise, Michael, actually. <SEP> depending on supply and demand, it seems that the demand function of "fresh ether" lowered <SEP> @bastaware and even more miners are mining due to a certain trend in europe,  certain chinese btc-farms switched to ethereum therefore the supply is grown faster than the demand and even in theory this means a lowered market price
<SEP> Hey guys <SEP> Is it possible to password-protect one's Ethereum wallet? <SEP> Hey there how long does it take to get my  wallet synced?

<SEP> you speak erlang? <SEP> I know a bit <SEP> am looking into functional languages lately too <SEP> anybody in cryptokitties? <SEP> www.cryptokitties.co <SEP> Lol not me <SEP> I like Nim for languages <SEP> I wonder how hard it would be to start a legal Ethereum business <SEP> We take in businesses who hire our team to build/maintain a product by the day/week <SEP> A team of 5 developers, who do have an account/lawyer outsourced, and a marketer, spend a couple hours per day per business <SEP> We don't charge as much as we can, we charge fair rates ($120 \* people \* hours) <SEP> Start means start + make profitable <SEP> @phalexo And me were discussing it in concept, neither of us plan on doing it <SEP> I'm just thinking about it <SEP> A legal American/European business with fully legal employees/no outsourcing, all vetted <SEP> Eh. I've said enough. You get the idea <SEP> @kayabaNerve I am not sure what you mean by "legal American/European". I am working through the corporation I set up in Wyoming. It is a legal entity, I have a federal employer id number for the IRS, etc... It is a legal entity. <SEP> @phalexo that. <SEP> All my existing operations have just been we meet up after some internet chat on another internet chat, you agree to pay me money, I give you proof, you give me money, I give you code <SEP> That's legal but I don't have a business behind it <SEP> And again. Legal. But I'm talking about a LLC or so. <SEP> *please don't call the IRS on me* <SEP> @kayabaNerve I see. Thank you so much.
<SEP> hi how to become a.miner I??? <SEP> @joanoatienza_twitter do you want to mine on your computer/hardwre or purchase a cloud mining contract <SEP> @phalexo your like a Rottweiler <SEP> That poor kid never stood a chance talking about machine learning <SEP> Talking about Algos, like dude it's not fucking easy first of all, second Algos use ASICS to compute a lot of the math and trades <SEP> @lsaether I am interested in tutoring <SEP> What kind of help you nerd? <SEP> I mean need lol <SEP> Solidity? <SEP> yeah <SEP> does Gitter have a dm feature? <SEP> Yea /query <SEP> http://www.bitdemon.net/article-categories/how-to-programming-guide/ <SEP> thats an alternative to getting started with solidity, but the offical readthedocs for solidity is good <SEP> if coinbase is mediocre than kraken is cat shit
<SEP> Hi guys. I am offering my ZIGURAT VERY CHEAP here https://etherdelta.com/#0xe760a89967d8c7fa638eebfc15a77ba107674021-ETH https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2464508.0 <SEP> I know this is a developer platform so please excuse my ignorance as I really need some help. In Etherscan it shows my balance related to a recent token purchase. However, it has not shown in MYEtherWallet in over a week. I have tried to get the Etherscan amount to cross over to MyEtherWallet to no success. I can access both accounts no problem, but the MyEtherWallet account address is different than the account address listed in the Etherscan account and I believe that is where my problem is, but I tried to Import the account into MyEtherWallet, but it doesn't seem receptive of that. I hate to bother you all but even my IT friend is lost as he doesn't trade in Bitcoin type markets. Please respond to "tonyer62@yahoo.com" <SEP> I created an account in my wallet then went o coinbase and transfered a small amount of eth to it.  before syncing could complete.  the account disapeared from my wallet app. <SEP> I am looking at tweo keystore files that I think represent the wallets. not sure how to get the wallets back

Know its not optimal but, . Does EthOS support wifi? And if so, can somebody provide a link that'll direct me to the right instructions for wireless internet configuration within EthOs? <SEP> depending on your wifi device it might auto-detect it <SEP> But need to input wpa passphrase.. <SEP> http://askubuntu.com/questions/461825/connect-to-wifi-from-command-line <SEP> officially they say this  <SEP> I know the wifi device from Alfa is being detected in Ubuntu. But there its easy with a GUI to input details. <SEP> Ah thanks Jeff I'll take a look at that link <SEP> no worries :) you may have to go through command line.. but since ethos is based on ubuntu then you will have wifi.. like you said its not ideal but hey.. sometimes its the only option.. so i hope it works out for you :) <SEP> 1 Btc - 55 Eth Make ETH & pass to Btc Is not bad idea <SEP> Great, once I've got my rig setup I'll give it a try. Thanks! :smile: <SEP> What can anyone help understand ...

I want to make somwhat centralized blockchain <SEP> to reduce the storage and increase scalability <SEP> I dont need any incentives for miners for now..just want to test the core concept of my idea <SEP> is it possible using etherum? <SEP> yepp that's possible, some of the clients are quite modular and can be used for systems with alternative levels of (de)centralization / consensus algorithms <SEP> thanx a lot @Gustav-Simonsson <SEP> guys i need your help how can i claim the unclaimed eth that i have by supporting this site when eth was starting <SEP> via the crowd funding <SEP> @ThePhotonTech so you must have received some receipt to claim your ether <SEP> from the crowdsale <SEP> you can import your pre-sale wallet in the official Mist wallet <SEP> To import your presale via Mist / Ethereum Wallet, start it up, let it sync (takes a day or so), go to "Accounts" - <SEP> @dcoolnik for storage of larger files there is IPFS and Swarm
<SEP> What is a good non-US based BTC/ETH exchange? <SEP>  how to mine ether with a pool? <SEP> @marwanfarah There is a Gitter room for mining somewhere in here, you'll probably have better luck asking there.
<SEP> ? <SEP> They buy it <SEP> hmm but that sucks i mean speculants and the banksters just speculate the prize into an explosion <SEP> then u could end up in a situation that u cant use your digital assets <SEP> i mean it is crazy enough to do longterm payment contracts in bitcoin like you have to do with the omni system because u suddenly cannot pay the running costs because bitcoin has doubled in value.... <SEP> that is why bitcoin has such huge transaction costs today... the banksters have become cheaper than bitocoin when it comes to transactions <SEP> a personal opinion luke <SEP> do you think its better to create an own blockchain mining community for a coin or just use ethereum? <SEP> nowadays? <SEP> Ethereum by far <SEP> reasons? <SEP> more secure from 51%? <SEP> can u give me reasons? <SEP> Secure, people use it, easier to develop for <SEP> and what is about the unsecure highly volatile transaction costs? <SEP> is ether designed to be possible to be unlimited mined? <SEP> or are there halvings and caps and etc.? <SEP> It's not unsecure or volatile lol <SEP> It won't be mined infinitely
<SEP> Can private Ethereum Chains be created outside of testnet for commercial use?  For example, the private ethereum chain is created for internal use (i.e. @ banks or other firms) that does not interact with the public blockchain nor requires publicly available ETH to process transactions? <SEP> and if that is possible, how would that impact the ETH price that is public? <SEP> of the public ETH <SEP> as it looks like less adoption and use of the public chain <SEP> but in reality the tech is being used

<SEP> Hi guys! <SEP> I wanted to run an idea of something i wanna create <SEP> And how would be the best way to integrate (if even at all possible) with the ethereum network <SEP> Does anyone here have time? <SEP> @S4v3E4rthCh4n_twitter Is there anything you wanna know about Ethereum? <SEP> Yeah, a shitload <SEP> For instance, how long will casper run hybrid Pos/PoW? <SEP> Sounds like the hybrid PoS/PoW might go on for awhile <SEP> And even after that, that there will be a PoW chain <SEP> Did i understand that correctly? <SEP> @AliceTheHive <SEP> hahaha... hmmm <SEP> Well we designed this power plant to be 100% sustainable <SEP> Based on the obscure OTEC principle <SEP> We were just wondering if it were logical to have the prototype power the ethereum network <SEP> As blockchain tends to attract more attention than sustainability <SEP> Atleast... from investors wanting to make a quick buck <SEP> Yeah i did see that <SEP> But since we are only building a protoype, to demonstrate capabilities <SEP> We have an excess of power which cannot be attached to the power grid <SEP> So it is not mission-critical <SEP> Yeah it is <SEP> But we have found it quite hard to find investors <SEP> Yeah <SEP> Hydro and solar <SEP> it is... also has terra-forming potential... would need to work that out in a later iteration <SEP> For now we just wanna demonstrate it so we can grab the attention of green initiatives <SEP> So we thought, if we run an ICO and generate tokens that have a stake in the future of the design, we might be able to fund the prototype <SEP> Nah, we can just use the excess produced water to automate crop growing and create spaces of open water in deserted areas <SEP> But coming back to the ICO, seems like it would be most effective if it were to "mine blocks" seeing as how it wouldn't do anything <SEP> Right? <SEP> So it would be beneficial if we could mine a few hundred thousand, even during PoS <SEP> But, will mining under PoS be as lucrative as under PoW? <SEP> Or validation, or whatever you wanna call it... <SEP> Or will it be significantly less? <SEP> I see... <SEP> So it would be risky either way <SEP> Today 10cents could be 1000dollars in future, but it could go vice-versa... :smile: <SEP> Yeah that is true <SEP> But with once PoS comes out... Won't there a huuuuge spike in ETH prices? <SEP> Hmmm... <SEP> Some may terms it as classic, vintage... I used to have something that cost 10cents once, now valued at 1000 dollars... LOL... :laughing: <SEP> Probably, and probably not! <SEP> That's inflation...! <SEP> LOL! <SEP> Are you also a dev? <SEP> Or just an entusiast? <SEP> Technology-Enablers... :smile: So Dev is part of it...! <SEP> What could you do with Ethereum?

<SEP> Ho ho ho <SEP> Read up on block-chain technology <SEP> Ethereum is unique in that it can run software on decentralized computers (very difficult to corrupt the code or to take down a critical number of computers for the program not to run) <SEP> Of course it's also about transferring money without worrying about security , government banking restrictions /weak local currencies, international exchange costs, quick and cheap sending of a lot of money ex. $4,000 in under an hour (something that takes banks a lot of time to do) .... <SEP> Hi Everyone  i had a freewallet.org  wallet i have some POWR tokens in i cant see them in there . please help <SEP> any casper updates! <SEP> ivb9 <SEP> o <SEP> p <SEP> k

This means that 15,626,576 will be created every year on top of the 60m and the two pools.

<SEP> hey guys <SEP> 1 question <SEP> how do i mine etherum now? <SEP> cuz, i was reading that the ethminer its down now <SEP> or something like that <SEP> so how do i mine now? <SEP> @kchomontiel  buy some GPUs, install a mining software join a pool, pay alot for electricity and hope you earn more than you pay <SEP> Thanks @lukas-berlin , i know the par of gpus and the electricity <SEP> i mean the software stuff <SEP> part* <SEP> there are a lot of tutorials on the web how to build an ethereum mining rig <SEP> ok @lukas-berlin ! ill read more, Thank you <SEP> so for my case, i need to contact my exchange on the withdrawal problem? transaction id shows there is an internal invoke. <SEP> @abcgoodyabc  check the tokenbalance of your exchange address. When you have tokens on the exchange adress you need to contact the exchange. <SEP> can u help me see? i paste the link <SEP> you can check the token balance here https://etherscan.io/token/Humaniq <SEP> Hi, can someone tell me how to redraw eth from etherscan? <SEP> @Aikon77 you cant. etherscan is just a block explorer.

<SEP> Can someone explain what this soft fork does and also direct me to where someone from the foundation explains what is going on.  I am not seeing that anywhere. <SEP> @NG_Fourth_twitter https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/17/critical-update-re-dao-vulnerability/ and https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/06/24/dao-wars-youre-voice-soft-fork-dilemma/ <SEP> basically its up to the miners now <SEP> @Zoltu  It is not a contract, is a token <SEP> You can follow a pattern where any contract method that doesn't do anything with received Ether will automatically throw.  This will protect the contract's users from accidentally sending their ether to the void. <SEP> @picojoule I have read the Etherum Blogs. I read them as soon as I saw them come out over the past few days.  I guess my question is why is there not more information about this since it is such a HUGE issue. <SEP> @NG_Fourth_twitter is there any information in particular that you're interested in? theres been almost an overwhelming amount of discussion about it on reddit and here IMO <SEP> It is a huge issue, although more so for the DAO than for ethereum itself. It was a case of a smart contract written in a way that was insecure <SEP> @Zoltu  and then I can send ether to the dao? <SEP> @pat22rpc I think I may be misunderstanding what you want to do.  Can you explain exactly what your goal is?

<SEP> Hi <SEP> May I ask, how can I earn Ethereum and making profit? <SEP> Trading. <SEP> hi , I met someone today who was telling me that he was creating his own tokens and then allowing the users to mine them to release extra tokens . Bit confused since my understanfing is that tokens are created on Ethereum  as a smart contract. You are unable to mine your own tokens since Ether based tokens are intrinsically bound to Ethereum platform. So you can only mine on the Ethereum platform ? <SEP> I do not believe you can "mine" tokens, I see people use the terminology "mint" for token tho <SEP> So what were the changes of Byzantium? <SEP> Now less gas is required for transactions? <SEP> @SteveMiddle12_twitter You can add a function to your token contract to do some work (i.e. mine) in exchange for your tokens. You can then give out token either from your original supply or mint on demand. <SEP> how can this be done , since its all running on Ethereum and to generate more tokens e.g. mint would require you to interact with the smart contract . are there any examples of this implementation ? <SEP> OMG mints, check it's contract <SEP> Guys can anyone here help me?? <SEP> i have asked a few times had one guy try to help but unfortunately we couldn't get a solution, i currently have my Ether stuck and cannot do anything with it <SEP> Do we have to create some account(sign up) on Ethereum to get started with live ethereum mining? <SEP> @SteveMiddle12_twitter Now you are asking someone to do your research for you. It is possible to set up tokens to be mined. Period. Learn Solidity, figure it out. <SEP> Or we just need to deploy our contract on Azure /Amazon ? <SEP> ? <SEP> Can anyone help me?  I downloaded the ethereum mist.   Im having a hard time to just get it to come back up.. I have the icon on my desk top but it seems like it just wants me to download it again .  Can I now just log in through the site or something?  I am also having trouble with the wallet.  I am very new to this so please bare with me lol.  Thank you everyone. <SEP> con anyone help me? i created contract on main network using ethereum wallet but it stuck in "Crating contract" status

<SEP> Hi Looking for a developer who can create an asset based cryptocurrency on Ethereum <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Mind explaining? <SEP> Well forgive the ignorance: A client is looking to set up a cryptocurrency which is backed by physical tradeable assets such as Platinum and Ethanol... <SEP> eg 1 Token will be equal to 1 gram of platinum metal. <SEP> How does ETH work? <SEP> I'm new to the whole digital currency scene. I currently don't own any BTC or ETH. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Tks!! <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You would have to set the price manually or offer an exchange <SEP> You can't do it solely on the chain <SEP> @thatonetrick_twitter It's a cryptocurrency. Your wallet is a set of data used to sign transactions (say that it was you). <SEP> Your balance is a number on a dataset contained by thousands os different computers that verify each other. <SEP> The the price would be set against the price of the physical asset trading on the global markets. eg. If the price of  platinum is $35per gram then the token will be trading at $35 and have its price change according to the platimum held. There will be physical platimum held in storage. <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter So what needs to be done is a generic ERC20 <SEP> Then you need a central exchange to fix the price <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You'd have to rely on an outside service to feed platinum prices into the contract all the time. Will you be making a market to keep the prices linked? <SEP> @phalexo The coin doesn't need the price. The exchange does. <SEP> And the number doesn't matter if it has no backing. <SEP> So they need an exchange and a standard ERC20 with whatever constructor they choose. (I mean, doesn't have to be ERC20 but...) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Maybe  I am wrong but I think he wants to accept fiat currencies in exchange for platinum. These coins would essentially be depository receipts. <SEP> The coin itself can be linked to a gram of platinum of particular purity, this does not need to change, but allowing people to buy with USD, EURO is more involved. <SEP> Thanks yes. More or less. There is going to be reliance on an official price feed which will then automatcally translate in value to the coin <SEP> Yeah but that's exchange level <SEP> How do you mean? Because we are saying buy 1 token equal to 1 gram which is stored in Vault X. The token moves according to the price of the platinum traded on the global markets <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Are you fixing the coin price to platinum or something else? <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter To enforce that, you need to have an exchange that sets the price and buy/sells for that amount. <SEP> Else, the market will decide the value. <SEP> Even if the coin stores a number labelled value, that doesn't make it worth that. <SEP> To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams or have a exchange for the fiat (or crypto) equivalent per coin <SEP> If a coin could say and enforce a value, I would make one for 100 USD rn and sell them all <SEP> You can have the exchange in the coin but then you're stuck with a ETH/ERC20 value map <SEP> Ok so if I am hearing you right. We need to create an exchange for the cryptocurrency Buy/Sell <SEP> Is that right? <SEP> Yes <SEP> You need to buy and sell the coin for that value <SEP> If you only sell it, then you can't use it. It's worthless <SEP> Only buy? It doesnt get distribution <SEP> Let's say they take a deposit of 1 gram of Pt from a citizen, and issue 1 token to signify that any time this citizen wants a gram of Pt back all he has to do is send in his 1 coin. There is no need for making the market. The coin is pegged to the value of platinum. <SEP> You only need to make a market if you want rates to float. <SEP> And that counts as an exchange <SEP> "To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams" <SEP> No idea how the group makes money though <SEP> They're the only exchange in this idea. They can't sell to themselves <SEP> Some fees for storage. <SEP> I guess. Why not just keep the Platinum then? <SEP> Providing security. <SEP> Ok can it be done? If so how long would it take to launch? <SEP> Commodity exchanges are regulated,, you need to consult with attorneys if you can legally do this and if you need to register your exchange. <SEP> And then there's the issue if something does happen to the platinum <SEP> Everyone would sue you for the money <SEP> You need to talk to people about accepting Fiat if you do that <SEP> If you just take Eth, you can get the exchange software up in a few days <SEP> You said this was a client of yours? May I ask what your job is?

<SEP> How can I start a project for ethereum uses in the food industry? <SEP> @dannygkass Real world use cases are a ways off, but I'm interested in what you have in mind. <SEP> Possibly creating a system where you use the timestamp feature to track the freshness of all the raw ingredients  along the food chain so that a customers at a restaurants that uses this systems can show it customers the data of all its ingredients and etc. This could help customers make batter choices on what to eat and help restaurants gain more trust among it customers which equals more business.
<SEP> not able to create an account with ethereum wallet UI <SEP> i enter the password, but nothing happens. it still says I have no account. <SEP> what is the difference between this UI and geth cli tool?
<SEP> @robipuha_twitter my node was synced but the chain keeps on growing so when your offline for a while you have sync the blocks that where mined during your offtime <SEP> @lukas-berlin Ha. So it means it's neverending story. All the time somebody will mine new blocks. So it means each time you will open Ethereum App it will require to synchronize. And if you are not there for few weeks -- it's the same story like I have now :) <SEP> My impression is, unless you are an eth miner, you dont need to be synced with all the blocks <SEP> In that case, you can start mist in light mode <SEP> @robipuha_twitter yes every ~15s theres a new block. Thats the blockchain, it keeps on growing until the last node shuts down.
<SEP> Hey Chris Hafey you around? <SEP> I got the Ledger Nano S  which I use for the Ether only. Is there a way to buy and sell directly from the ledger, or do I have to send the ether to like coinbase then buy and sell, then send it back to the ledger? Also I was wondering is there a way to view your ether stored without having it plugged in? <SEP> You need an exchange like coinbase to buy/sell ethere to other currencies like USD <SEP> hello@Chris Hafey
<SEP> Hello guys. Quick question after i buy btc how can i exchange them for eth? Please note that i am based in lebanon in the middle east. thanks <SEP> @Ziadjbt78_twitter sell your BTC for ETH on any exchange trading ETH too: bittrex, bitfinex, bitstamp etc <SEP> @hegrz thanks for your answer. Are all those exchanges international? and do u suggest any particular one with the least fees? <SEP> Be careful though on their payout requirements. Sending BTC to them is the easy part. As soon as you withdraw, they may come up with all kinds of verification bullshit, and you may have a hard time getting the Ether out. <SEP> all are offering their services internationally; bittrex is US american, bitfinex taiwanese, bitstamp european <SEP> and the one with the least fees? <SEP> fees are tiny everywhere <SEP> check for yourself <SEP> Ok so i think i will go for Bittrex as i heard good things about this exchange. anyone else in here trade there? please do share your feedback if any. thanks <SEP> @Ziadjbt78_twitter bittrex is a good exchange, trusted for years but remember every exchange has to follow its local finance regulations, KYC etc <SEP> you have to sell your ETH for fiat <SEP> @Ziadjbt78_twitter I have not  used Bittrex personally, but there was a person here who had an issue with a lost transaction from Bittrex (it was only 1.017 ether) and they refunded the lost  ether. <SEP> thanks guys appreciate it. <SEP> @phalexo read somewhere you are planning to release your own Ethereum based tokens soon. May I know what is it about as I might be interested. Is this an ICO? <SEP> @Ziadjbt78_twitter That is my current plan. I have been building a knowledge system platform. The first generation is here http://linkffiti.com, we have developed a prototype for the second generation technology that will combine machine learning, crowdsourcing. The goal is to create a smart, evolving layer of WWW interconnections on top of the web. People spend 2-3 hours a day googling for information they need to do their jobs. The system is intended to preserve work done, memorialize meta data so that others can benefit. The blockchain micropayments would be used to compensate users for quality research, and have others pay for improved information. <SEP> @phalexo ok thanks man i will make sure to check it out <SEP> another question guys. trying to buy some btc from localbitcoins.com and many sellers are charging 8% over market price. is that normal? shouldnt it be around 2 - 3 % max? isnt 8% extremely high and unreasonable? whats ur feedback on this?

Been sitting at 3.8mil blocks for two days. <SEP> @cramer_lukas_twitter you can export the blocks as an RLP and look into through all TX there. I have a python spagetthi script that does  this. If that helps <SEP> Cookies or Auroras? <SEP> Hello all, I''m part of a game development team that is about to launch an ICO next week. I wanted some critique on our website and Whitepaper.

<SEP> @lukas-berlin @hegrz  Okay. How if, can I control the amount of my token to be available? For example, I can set 100k amount of token available, later i increase the amount to 200k, is it possible? <SEP> @ChongHan90  yes you can program everything. <SEP> @lukas-berlin Ok. For increasing amount of tokens, is it I just need to only pay the gas to miner to process my request? There is not other fee like buying more ETH to increase amount of the token right?

So...First I had Token in IQ Option, I sent them from IQ to the Ethereum wallet created earlier. Now I can't see Token in wallet... <SEP> @stacy70_twitter  do you have the public hash of the transaction? <SEP> ! <SEP> Here, I have send here the Token <SEP> @stacy70_twitter  do you have any idea where can i have a eBooks for beginners in ETH (Mining) <SEP> @bhotnie how about google search? if you are not tech saavy trust me, you're behind on the race of mining <SEP> @bhotnie No, sorry...There isn't a support to ask questions <SEP> Nothing!!!! <SEP> @stacy70_twitter  i sent you a private message . go read it <SEP> Ok <SEP> @bhotnie  start mining is straight forward, no books needed. if there was a book, it would have like 3 pages <SEP> @sousacanfly I see, I just starting knowing about ETH
<SEP> @kayabaNerve Let's say, an application with blockchain has 1000 users, it's may happen that 10 of the 1000 users launch TXs at the same time, which means that logically the smart contract will be interacted at the same time. If the smart contract is singleton and how does this TXs are done on blockchain? <SEP> @mingbai so. TXs aren't handled instantly <SEP> They have to be verified by mining <SEP> Once a group of transactions is mined, all work by others to mine that block is thrown out <SEP> So it isn't all at once <SEP> And then miners do order transactions sequentially <SEP> That said, I forget how and if it just checks for errors (no double send), or if you can get and send in the same block <SEP> @DewaldDeJager Right, it was just an example. What about being dropped politicallysensitivetabootokens though. <SEP> I'm not to worried personally, but could envision problems in general. <SEP> I did not realize that Netheralnds is a police state. <SEP> Those would go into the trash instead of being plastered on a public ledger via an account I might choose to be associated with. <SEP> @phalexo all states besides anarchist states are <SEP> Duh <SEP> @phalexo It's not too bad, I wish we had more and better equipped police myself. <SEP> :) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Let me clarify it easy. Mining on a block only accessible by one miner at once and so the TXs are sequentially mined into the block, which means that the mark of completion of a transaction is whether it's mined or not.  Even a group of TXs are coming at the same time, the mining process will deal with them sequentially to the block. <SEP> @kayabaNerve So at the bottom of mine() process is a single thread process.... Am I right? <SEP> @Jesin You're right, but I have means to prevent people from sending me spam or pamphlets if it gets annoying. I'll just have to see about PenisCoins and such. <SEP> Oh well, interesting times. <SEP> I'll shut up now and wait for or write a prevent_penis_token_drop.sol contract or something. <SEP> It's been fun chatting, best of luck everyone :) <SEP> @mingbai No <SEP> Just no

So I told her to download the latest version and attempt a sych.   She did, and it worked.   However, the new wallet version does not show her "smart contract wallet" that she made from the old version. It only shows her main account holdings.  She then opened up the old version, which showed that it synched, shows the "smart contract wallet" with the holdings.   However, in the old version when she goes to send her Ether... it doesn't work.   Any idea's? <SEP> @JDSBali21 Is this Parity? <SEP> Like what about how bug the Ethereum Foundation is? Swarm? EIPs? <SEP> I personally think they should focus on Ethereum, Solidity, Web3, and maybe EIPs...

I did not realize that I couldnt send funds to my account in that mode. I sent my Ether to the main account. It shows that the transfer was validated on the coinbase side but nothing on the Mist side. I am worried I lost my ether? I am very new to this and am confused. Any help would be greatly appreciated. <SEP> @fears000_twitter Did you send it to the main account on testnet, or main account on main Eth network? <SEP> @laken Yup:/ <SEP> @laken Sorry, clarification. Main account on test net <SEP> I'm not certain and can't verify right now, but I don't think you can send from main net to test net <SEP> test net cannot store 'real' eth <SEP> So if you've actually made a txn from coinbase to a testnet account, it may be lost <SEP> What were you trying to accomplish? Coinbase is an ether wallet. <SEP> @fears000_twitter this may help: https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/5443/coins-gone-to-test-net-account-and-didnt-retain-pw-for-network-main-account <SEP> Google some, there are plenty of people asking the same question <SEP> @laken I have the closest thing I have found is this: "All accounts are common for both testnet and livenet, just sync your ethereum wallet with livenet and you should see the ether you sent from coinbase to your account" <SEP> If you export from parity in test mode, you should be able to import the account back and use that to access your ether <SEP> Hello @fears000_twitter <SEP> They're two separate blockchains <SEP> You sent your ether to the account with the same address on the main net <SEP> You can't get it back <SEP> Also, @laken , testnet eth is eth. <SEP> It's just not eth from the mainnet <SEP> And can't be used like main net eth <SEP> The only thing that makes a testnet a testnet is purpose and a new genesis block <SEP> I guess it's like the debate about ETC vs ETH <SEP> ETH had txs reversed. ETC didn't. <SEP> Same genesis though... <SEP> `TheGreatNi` Thank God there's a site to download the blockchain from, geth is slooooow <SEP> Are there locations to withdraw the cash from etheruem or can it go directly to a bank account? <SEP> @kayabaNerve  Well, we will chalk that up to live and learn. Thanks for your help. <SEP> @jrtapsell Is this in responce to my problem? <SEP> @laken You asked for help because it ain't working for you the way you have done it so far. If instead of following advice (my blockchain is all synced up) you want to argue and lecture on how it's supposed to be done normally, be my guest, but I am not spending another second of my time looking at the useless pictures.  Good luck. <SEP> @fears000_twitter If you sent your Ether to one of the testnet networks (which you are warned  by the way, NOT to do) I can help you recover your ether, if and only if  you still have your testnet keyfile (or  a backup) and you still remember your testnet passphrase. <SEP> @fjh1997 If you can import your keyfile into any other wallet that is already synced up you will be able to transact. <SEP> @phalexo is any other wallet recommended?
<SEP> hey how do I make an account? <SEP> how do I mind bit ethereum <SEP> @ztr5 Use MyEtherWallet <SEP> And "mind bit"? <SEP> Are you asking how to mine Ethereum? <SEP> Get a ton of GPUs and join a pool. Mining is only for another month though <SEP> @kayabaNerve  No idea hehe <SEP> I am new only in this chat FYI <SEP> Yeah <SEP> But I didn't know if you joined from an ad in a Spanish Speaking community <SEP> @kayabaNerve  are you using google translate? :smile: <SEP> Or a famous Spanish Eth person recommended you <SEP> No. <SEP> I'll translate a word or two per message but not mainly <SEP> I see. <SEP> I guess we might as well decentralize countries and languages too. <SEP> No more borders :fire: <SEP> Countries are decentralized, arguably :P <SEP> There's no one country <SEP> And I like Lojban <SEP> Esperanto is more... human though <SEP> unconvertable
<SEP> Excuse me, how can I modify my token's ICON? <SEP> @ixhxpns You mean the three letter symbol? <SEP> ETH, BTC, SWT, EOS... those? <SEP> He is just confusing Etherscan with the blockchain itself. <SEP> @phalexo Not exactly. Most ERC20s have a public symbol field. <SEP> If your token isn't registered, Etherscan will still pick up on it <SEP> He is asking about an ICON. It's a picture. <SEP> Got it. That's why I was asking :P <SEP> I find it fascinating the EVM maps everything by its name <SEP> We also never uploaded the ABI/source. We probably should have... https://etherscan.io/token/0xd233495c48eb0143661ffc8458eafc21b633f97f But it still recognizes as HYD/Hydra since it has the standard out-of-standard name/symbol extras. <SEP> There is really no such thing as registering a token. Etherscan just picks up the first Transfer event to populate its database. <SEP> Compare: https://etherscan.io/token/0xd233495c48eb0143661ffc8458eafc21b633f97f https://etherscan.io/token/0xf230b790e05390fc8295f4d3f60332c93bed42e2 <SEP> Etherscan handles name/symbol automatically, but not logo/price. <SEP> There is a menu to add urls, logos, etc... <SEP> So it's not as much as say, CoinMarketCap, but it does exist... <SEP> That's still registering it <SEP> As I mentioned above, a single `Transfer` event is enough for Etherscan to pick up a token, it then gets the name/symbol   by calling name(), symbol() methods, the first time it sees an event from that ERC20 token. <SEP> Hello have gotten some issue again, I lost my keystore file, and my private key .

<SEP> i want to earn easy cryptocurrency <SEP> there are bountys for developers <SEP> like good returns and small investment <SEP> anY other cryptocurrenct that will be profitable by mining <SEP> There is no easy money, unless you start selling your body <SEP> You may be lucky, but thats an exception <SEP> sad <SEP> cryptocurrency is money, and as money no one is willing to give for free <SEP> yeah i know <SEP> but im ready to do mining <SEP> but im not ready also <SEP> i mnot getting if it is profitable or no <SEP> You should do more research about what you are investing in, than you may be more confident about the profitability <SEP> lol , i still dont know where i want to invest <SEP> If you expect to sell fast, you may not earn much, but if you long on ethereum you may get profits when it's valueble, as ethereum is gas for the descentralized world computer. <SEP> will ether be going to be in demand as btc?

<SEP> Hey <SEP> Any update on the frozen ETC? <SEP> What's the point of this chat? It seems to be a long list of unanswered questions. Which isn't a chat!
<SEP> Hi <SEP> how much blocks or satoshi vs ethereum.. tell me now <SEP> Hi everybody!!! I'm super stoked to see crypto exploding. <SEP> I have a question about peers, if this is the right place to ask. <SEP> The question is, how to get more peers? <SEP> More peers = faster download of the blocks??? <SEP> How to get more peers for Ethereum? <SEP> Well the download should be limited by your bandwidth <SEP> Unless this is  because it isn't reaching max bandwidth? <SEP> hi guys. nervous email from a non-coder. you've probably had this question a thousand times already but - I sent Ether from my wallet 20 mins ago but nothing has arrived at the address  yet and there's no transaction entry on the chain. The address is good, I sent it with an average gas price. could there be a problem or should I be more patient? It's the longest i've ever had to wait <SEP> `Quiark` adobaby, well as long as the balance of original addr didn't decrease ...
<SEP> o <SEP> that is the systematic interest of the speculants to cash in on the ethereums users dependency on ether. <SEP> they have to have a solution for that. <SEP> currently lots of information inefficency rules the system <SEP> whats ur opinion prediction of ether in the near future <SEP> ether pricver* <SEP> price** <SEP> my opinion now after long researching its affect is that they have to fix their ether supply affordability and speculants problem <SEP> or all that trusted in them are going to be drained systematically. <SEP> so you are saying ether has a chance of basically getting wiped out? <SEP> u will not get ether for your wallet because speculants are systematically holding it back knowing that you depend on it. <SEP> it has potential to become a prison for its users. <SEP> constantly fucked up by speculations on the ether supply price and availability <SEP> i am not an IT expert but a solution could be a form of inclusive mining all ethereum wallets are also automatically ethereum miners,  the ethereum supply grow with number of wallet miners maybe even certified. something like that could fix the problem of speculants deflating and shorting ether supply because that is whats going to happen if more and more people start using ethereum to store assets. <SEP> i am very sceptical about these speculants, this might become a hugely impacting long term issue that is beeing held down for profit interests of those and not told publically, not by the developers and not by many people inside the system

I am studying. if you find out let us know. <SEP> @crypto_patron_twitter Adding to the above, I don't know your current level of blockchain/crypto knowledge, I'd recommend actually looking through the Ethereum white paper first  https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper and then read some of the beginning blogs out there.  Ethereum has some idiosyncrasies that can take a while to get used to (gas Prices, ABI encoding structure, Smart Contracts, etc.) that set it apart from other crypto offerings.  For me, just getting into smart contracts and deploying them a couple of times got me to understand how both the system worked alot better but Im better at learning through smashing my head against a wall for a while.  A Testnet faucet for Ropstein can be found here: https://faucet.metamask.io/ <SEP> HI All. Total nube .

<SEP> hi <SEP> Is there a section where we can post our ideas for dapps? <SEP> Hi guys, If some have basic questions on how to access your ETC while keeping your ETH safe, I made a tutorial for that :smile: http://whysos3rious.com/index.php/2016/07/27/tutorial-how-to-access-your-etc-and-sell-it-for-eth-fight-back-and-profit/ <SEP> @tomaso88 maybe on the solidity channel you can talk a bit about that or on reddit <SEP> also check the ethercamp hackathon <SEP> Hi. VCAP has been released, the first Ether token to fully fund a feature film. Let's get traffic going so we can show the range of Ether tokens. Go to www.vulturecaps.com. <SEP> @pftzs interesting, good luck <SEP> VCAP is here. It's a public independent film project, with domestic and foreign distribution.  It's the first film to be funded by cryptocurrency. If we are able to raise our budget using Vulture Capital, we would like to create a production company that works with the cryptocurrency community for future projects. For our next project, wed like to have coin holders be able to vote of what gets greenlit. This way Vulture Capital not only makes you an investor, but an active producer. It will also keep us, as film makers, honest and decentralized. <SEP> @Bunjin Thanks. <SEP> What we need for this to show it worth is for the Ether community's support to reach out goal. <SEP> Hi, can anyone help me with Myst for Win64? I can't get it to run.
<SEP> Hey guise <SEP> Does anyone wanna use this platform to help me save the world? <SEP> Good morning <SEP> Hi does anyone know where to get the latest stable binary for Alethzero?  The old github link seems to not work <SEP> ? <SEP> Hey has anybody an idea why my download of the wallet took for now about 40 Hours, and im not done yet (75%) i have 5 MBps... <SEP> Thats not unheard of <SEP> We dont have a light client yet <SEP> i am at 1.300.000 / 1.600.000 and from yesterday morning it just got me like 50.000, should I worry about? <SEP> And.. ? <SEP> the yesterday transaction said "Unable to locate Transaction entry" <SEP> O$ is a Token <SEP> Youre welcome <SEP> Is anyone printing low-denomination ethers or other altcoin on real-world counterfeit-proof paper? (like the type used to create hologram-protected concert tickets) Is anyone interested in discussing this? <SEP> I realise it sounds like the opposite direction to Going Digital, but there is method to my madness. <SEP> ??? <SEP> does this seem right? i tried to submit a toy test contract with an account that has 0.084 ether and got this error message.... "Account does not exist or account balance too low" ... I know that account has ether from this.. https://etherscan.io/address/0xd07ff71a29417a249f0f6f6b28f8e292ec1316ce Also, here is the toy contract.. http://pastebin.com/5vDXffnr <SEP> Hey I just did eth.getBalance(eth.coinbase) and it shows zero unlike that blockchain explorer!?!? Why? <SEP> then something like `c:\Users\huqibe\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum` <SEP> or `...\Local\Ethereum` <SEP> and in there should be keystore or something which contains your keys and is the most important part (you already did a backup of that anyway, right?) <SEP> @huqibe The files in the `keystore` folder are text files, so you can open them up in any text editor and copy the contents anywhere you feel would be safe.
<SEP> I am new to ethereum, 2 weeks ago I purchased 2 coins on polorias exchange and I transferred my coins to my new ethereum wallet.  After the coins did not arrive I read that the wallet has to fully sync first. well buggar me the wallet wouldn't sync, tried it for 4 days to start with, then I read to get in the command prompt and delete chain data so I done that... I'm not good with computers and this whole thing has been a disaster, I hope my coins are not lost for ever and I can get into my account.. I'm trying one last go at syncing and wallets at 39% if anyone has any tips, or can help please advise.... its been a shit experience not one to promote that's for sure <SEP> Thanks @hegrz - I'm going to try command line geth to execute transactions since I've already synced geth, I'll try parity if I can't get that to work. <SEP> how can I download ethereum wallet on new computer with the same account number as the wallet that didn't sync on my old computer, ive tried copying the files but it wont open ethereum wallet because of nodes, fucken shithouse system ethereum wallet, its the pits it really is for a novice
<SEP> hi team - i tried to transfer some ETH from coinbase to my address in Mist <SEP> coinbase says it transferred, but its not showing up in my wallet <SEP> checked the addresses and they look good <SEP> any idea how to figure out whats going on?
<SEP> Hi, looking for help, my wallet is not downloading past block 1150006, im using win 64 0 3 9. When i skip peer search, in wallet ui, console, i see cb=error message: failed to load resource net: ERR FILE NOT FOUND. file:///sockjs/info?cb=t2g62o6ozf , any suggestions , ty. <SEP> why is processing blocks taking so long? <SEP> Also, is it worth it to mine Ether or just use Cloudmining? <SEP> wat <SEP> Sounds like nonsense <SEP> Do your own reading/research <SEP> What you're saying doesn't make much sense IMO <SEP> No, it's true <SEP> Unlikely <SEP> Vitalik said it's his 2nd fav crypto <SEP> Doge will be sidechained <SEP> Can you elaborate further?
<SEP> hello <SEP> who was the developer of ETH again? <SEP> i forgot his name <SEP> :/ <SEP> Vitalik Buterin. <SEP> thanks <SEP> why does it say you are banned? <SEP> And its Ether, the coin and Ethereum the network <SEP> in the side thingy? <SEP> who what? <SEP> you <SEP> screenshot please? <SEP> http://i.imgur.com/LQ23eHI.png <SEP> look <SEP> :S <SEP> Where do you see that? <SEP> in the activity bar <SEP> I banned joeblow because he was spamming <SEP> oh i see <SEP> I dont see the activity bar <SEP> where is it? <SEP> http://i.imgur.com/wMOAGPL.png <SEP> oke <SEP> well <SEP> i am out again <SEP> cya <SEP>  <SEP> Hi i get an error in AletOne it says No OpenCL platform found <SEP> can someone help me to solve this? <SEP> thanks @MrGoatsy I learned something today! <SEP> @martinbrion that probably means your GPU isnt supported <SEP> But we are *not* service providers. We are an app platform. <SEP> Microsoft provides blockchain services. We build the actual platform. <SEP> @bobsummerwill  Thanks for that! I'll be looking into that soon! :D <SEP> Dapps are built on a platform. I disagree ;-) <SEP> I started up Geth but it has to load the entire blockchain? Didn't I already do that for the wallet? <SEP> @tehpikey Yes.   You can just CPU mine it, and you will get some.    Or somebody else on the test network can send you some.    I think there are probably faucits for it as well.    ConsenSys run their own alternative testnet as well. <SEP> Thanks @bobsummerwill , you're a champ. <SEP> @Galahan I believe that the Geth copy which comes bundles with Mist uses a different data directory.    Something which you can do to avoid this (but which won't help you now), is that Mist only uses the bundled Geth copy if there isn't already a node running.     So if you run geth FIRST, and then run Mist, it will connect to that running node, rather than launching its own. <SEP> But yeah - that doesn't help you right now.    But good to know. <SEP> Mist can also attach to a running eth (C++ node). <SEP> np, @tehpikey.
<SEP> Installed Wallet 0.7.3.  I selected option to use the test-net.  Not able to mine Ether. Yes, I waited until the entire blockchain was sync'd. <SEP> @justicemate_twitter  Takes quite a long time to sync.  Took about an hour for me.  What block are you at? <SEP> @petrsnm My problem was that it never started the Block download... The problem is now fixed. My system time was 1 minute off. In Windows 10, make sure you deactivate the auto time adjust, and then activate it again. When I did that, it corrected it to the correct minute. When I restarted the Geth process, it started to sync the blockchain... finally!
<SEP> Hi there, I'm a student keen on developing a simple application using blockchains. Can someone suggest where I could start, please. Secondly, are there github repos that I can take a look at that will help me along the way? <SEP> I am joining the Linux Foundation <SEP> I'm new to blockchain and was wondering how a single node could handle storage and access to a potentially massive database in distributed fashion. For example, the storage cost for potentially thousands or even millions of  duplicate databases could make blockchain cost prohibitive. Or could it? <SEP> @jeffcovelli_twitter Try syncing your wallet.
<SEP> I've been trying to speak to a human from Ethereum for months. Why isn't anyone answering e-mails?! <SEP> @BitcoinKhaleesi_twitter whats up? <SEP> What email address are you using? <SEP> Woah. Alex, it's a private matter. Can we switch to something more secure? I'm not a bot. <SEP> Is it about helpdesk? PM me. <SEP> It is. <SEP> PM you via...? <SEP> I probably wont be able to help but might be able to point you to someone who will. <SEP> That works too. <SEP> PM via what client? <SEP> Sent you a private message via gitter. <SEP> Or you can email me at avsa@ethereum.org <SEP> perfect! Look out for it. Thank you so much!

<SEP> I'm a Berlin-based journalist covering EU energy transitions. I'm now writing on peer-to-peer energy trading in the context of German Virtual Power Plants (VPP) controlling, aggregating and trading renewable electricity for over five years. How does Germany move to the next step in integrating higher levels of RES energy?

I'd like to learn more about Ethereum in this context, thanks <SEP> @ericmarx25 nice entry on the stage ;) ethereum is a blockchain tecch with some <SEP> very cool tools and concepts <SEP> @ericmarx25 what exactly do you want to know about ethereum in relation to the p2p energy trading market?
<SEP> hi <SEP> I definitely didn't get phished and the only place I've put my seed words is Indira. If you look at the wallet my ether got sent to there are similar transactions whereby they instantly go to that wallet after getting transferred in somewhere else <SEP> Infura* <SEP> Has anyone seen something like this before and is my ether just lost now <SEP> @reubik You meant bought on CB and sent to Metamask? <SEP> Why did you put your seed words on Infura? Sounds like you got phished <SEP> It's a bot where people scan compromised addresses for ETH and send when it comes in <SEP> Yeah that's what I mean. So how did I get phished? I didn't have to confirm any transactions on metamask <SEP> Your seed words are full wallet access <SEP> And I thought you needed to connect metamask to infura to generate an API key? <SEP> That's different from giving your seed words? <SEP> Seed words = private key. Metamask UI's just controls how the private key is accessed; it can't control how the private key is used outside of Metamask itself. <SEP> Also, I have no idea if the legit Infura requires some Metamask connection. You dont need to connect to Infura to use Metamask though... <SEP> Yeah I was tryna deploy a contract I wrote <SEP> Oh my bad I only had the key in my truffle.js <SEP> I didn't actually type it into infura but it must have got intercepted somehow I'm so confused <SEP> It can't get intercepted... <SEP> 1) Did you verify you actually sent it to your address? 2) How did you get Metamask? <SEP> Yeah it did get sent to my address, check the etherscan link. That's the address on metamask. I just got it through downloading the chrome extension <SEP> I can take any Etherscan link and claim it's my address. I'm asking if you've verified it's the one in Metamask. That's it. <SEP> Oh ok sorry! Yeah it is <SEP> You got compromised at some point. That's all I can say :/ <SEP> Sorry it happened to you <SEP> Ahh sucks man. Cheers for your help anyway. Ill just have to be more careful next time but I really don't know how this happened <SEP> If it was a different address (even the same start/end but different middle), I'd say you'd have a virus which scans for addresses on the clip board and replaces them. <SEP> I'd delete that extension and use MEW in the future (if you decide to try again) <SEP> Also send a small amount first to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again <SEP> Ok yeah <SEP> I'm kinda tied to the extension just cause of how I'm trying to use the ether but I guess what I can do is just make a new account, virus scan etc and store most of the ether in a MEW account <SEP> Thanks again for your help man <SEP> i have a question how to set my token logo in ethereum? <SEP> You can't; just on services around Ethereum <SEP> Hi. I am running a blockchain miner on azure and it is minings ethers. Are those real  ethers or just test ethers ? <SEP> @sahni619 That's not enough info; likely not mainnet ether if you make your money back. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  didn't get you ? So I am using a trial azure account and I have setup ethereum blockchain consortium on it and it has been mining.. I am able to use those when I add new rpc in metamask but if these are real ethers I should be able to use on main network as well.. Isn't? I am new to this so getting things to understand <SEP> How many have you mined? How much have you paid Azure? <SEP> You are correct that if they're mainnet Ether, you can use them on the mainnet. <SEP> till now those were  free credits of around 300 dollars <SEP> now I am left with 150 dollars free credit <SEP> nodes are still mining <SEP> How much ETH have you mined? <SEP> Over what time period is this? :P <SEP> If the answer is a few days and 0.1 ETH, it could be the mainnet <SEP> hehe.. So the answer is few days and a lot of ethers.. probably not main net <SEP> Yep <SEP> alrite thanks for clarifying :) <SEP> It's probably Ropsten. <SEP> appreciate your assistance <SEP> Or a private network <SEP> How will u get .1 ether unless u are not mining in pool <SEP> yes @bit-warrior  I got you now :D <SEP> it must be a private network then <SEP> but theres one more catch here.. I am able to create a smart contract using metamask and poa network and I  am able to  create ERC-20 token with all  those ethers.. <SEP> If you're mining, it isn't PoA <SEP> aah  ok..  So I will be able to do a crowdsale with these ethers using poa network wizard using there gui because I am able to do that <SEP> It's PoA, you're not mining. <SEP> PoA gets rid of mining. <SEP> And why would anyone buy Ethers on your centralized network?
<SEP> Hi everyone <SEP> Greetings, @vogelito!   Got a question? @/all Goes for anybody else here.   I'll be around for a bit. <SEP> Hey @bobsummerwill - I run an ether exchange in Mexico, https://bitso.com  The ethereum integration was incredibly straight forward thanks to the docs.  We want to help the ethereum project forward by introducing the concept of dapps/smart contracts to Mexico. We obviously have read about them and know their potential,  but have never coded/deployed one ourselves and dont really know where to start. The guide is ok, but too general, and the examples in github are too advanced. What would be the natural progression to get started? <SEP> Happy Birthday  <SEP> And from the inside, I can tell, the site is doing very well ;-) <SEP> Hello there, @vogelito!    Glad that things were smooth :-)  The most common starting point are @alexvandesande's tutorials and examples:  - https://ethereum.org/token - https://ethereum.org/crowdsale - https://ethereum.org/dao <SEP> @5chdn Happy birthday indeed.  Is there still some ongoing "promotion process" for the site? <SEP> oh wow, thats amazing. Thanks @bobsummerwill <SEP> If we have access to free elect <SEP> @Mottu88 On TESTNET you can mine pretty easily.  I turned on mist mining a while back and forgot about it.  Woke up to 700 ETH. <SEP> @Mottu88 Yes, mining on the public testnet is very easily.   You can even have success with CPU mining. <SEP> @tjade273 private I think as described on https://github.com/ethereum/mist/blob/master/Wallet-README.txt.   I downloaded Ethereum Wallet on my Mac and going thru the samples but when deploying the contract, it says the account you r sending from is empty. Do I need  to turn on mist?   @Zoltu  @bobsummerwill <SEP> Does Mist show TESTNET in red letters @Mottu88? <SEP> Though, at the moment I can't seem to sync with the testnet.  :/ <SEP> No peers. <SEP> @Zoltu yes.  I found some good stuff on mist and reviewing these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3JfLgjqNU4&feature=youtu.be <SEP> Yeah, Mist is a good choice. <SEP> You have it running now? <SEP> You can see your wallet, balance in the top right of 0, etc.?  @Mottu <SEP> Something like this: <SEP> ! <SEP> yeah its 0 and its running. <SEP> In the Develop menu at the top choose `Start Mining`. <SEP> Then wait a bit. <SEP> Should I believe. <SEP> Are you on `TEST-NET`?  Shows in red at the top? <SEP> ! <SEP> yes <SEP> Hmm.... maybe mining doesn't work on Mac OS X?  I have only tried it on Windows 10. <SEP> Try the Ethereum/mist channel?
<SEP> Hi to everyone, <SEP> i've a little question, i've started to mining from ethereum wallet, <SEP> i try to send it out to another wallet, it told me that the transaction was confirmed but nothing arrived ... is it norma ?
<SEP> Helle everybody. <SEP> I want trade ethereum. Please help <SEP> @quiroz_acuna_twitter which is your address <SEP> @Mikezz I am using parity <SEP> @kuncevic there is no date announced yet <SEP> @davimen just buy and sell it then? wheres the problem? <SEP> Hy all <SEP> @hegrz any idea when PoS will be implemented in Ethereum? <SEP> @noodlesftw there is no date announced yet <SEP> ohh okay <SEP> What are your thoughts on PoS? <SEP> it's progress <SEP> But then the only way to own ETH is to buy it instead of mining it, right? So the rich get richer.... <SEP> you still get rewarded by staking <SEP> is it so that the more ETH you have, the more likely you get rewarded? <SEP> the rich get richer like before (who could pay most for hardware and electricity got most) at PoS everbody linearly gets richer <SEP> @noodlesftw yes <SEP> but how does everybody get linearly richer? If I only own 0.0001 ETH for example <SEP> ok, if you own tiny amounts the chance to mine a block will get infinite small but thats the same like before, if you only mine with 1H/s you don't earn anything as well <SEP> Yeah but now you have to buy Ether instead of being able to mine it, right? So PoS makes us unable to mine new Ether <SEP> what you paid for hardware and energy before you now invest in ETH itself <SEP> and the network will safe the energy of a major city <SEP> hmmm okay <SEP> IOTA rising to rank 6 of all projects after market cap because if the scalability issues of all blockchain projects
<SEP> Hi <SEP> Could you tell me how can i interact with third party API from ethereum smart contracts..? <SEP> Hi @reddysmobile Have a look on  <SEP> Use oracalize <SEP> heh :) <SEP> Any other service plz.. <SEP> Why? Not good? <SEP> Just want to try some other if available... <SEP> Not that Im aware of <SEP> @gjeanmart  any other which you aware of.. <SEP> @reddysmobile No nothing else. But I guess you can develop your own oracle service. on design point of view it's "just" some kind of asynchronous transaction with callback. <SEP>  Etheropt, Reality Keys             what these two services will do? <SEP> Hello! Are there cryptographic opcodes to sign/verify messages without spending a lot of gas? <SEP> ECRECOVER <SEP> ah, cool, thanks :) <SEP> just wondering, couldn't an exchange on ethereum work 99% off-chain? users send buy/sell offers by signing an intention to sell at that price <SEP> with an expiration block, perhaps... a centralized party just keeps a public list of those intentions <SEP> and the taker sends a transaction with the seller's signed intention to sell <SEP> no need to make a book on chain, which is the expensive part afai <SEP> the worst thing the centralized part could do is vanish, but never steal anything so that sounds good enough <SEP> I am having issues with my new ethereum wallet syn, down is blocked, anyone have any ideas <SEP> @Bunjin, Thank you. <SEP> hi, i have been following this for a few weekos now and read tons of things regarding what ethereum is and how it works. <SEP> nevertheless i need help <SEP> @dylanbitran <SEP> fire away - what help do you need <SEP> can someone recomend me a few papers or material to understend this better? <SEP> ok thank you <SEP> i want to know if ethclassic is going to die or not, also i want to start building easy dapps in solidity but i dont know nothing about programming <SEP> just for testing i mean, not really serious dapps <SEP> i still cant understand much of how everything fits and correlates to make this work as a whole (sorry my english im frome chile) <SEP> from* <SEP> and of course start mining by miself with my laptop but i dont know wich client to use <SEP> @dylanbitran  have you read through this https://ethereum.org <SEP> @kadesola1_twitter join an exchange deposit fiat , buy eth <SEP> and another question: if i wanted to get into the blockchain i have to use a client (right? i dont know much about this) so why there arent any nodes nor clients using solidity instead of go (the lenguage that uses geth right?) (also i dont know wich lenguage uses parity) <SEP> @dylanbitran  I never even looked at or went near ethclassic after the fork.  The couple of eth I had their on that chain I just left it.  No interest in it at all personally. <SEP> Ok,how do I join an exchange deposit <SEP> @dylanbitran there are a few  ways to develop for ethereum scroll up through the chat I posted a few links yesterday <SEP> @kadesola1_twitter  its up to you what exchange you go to, go to their website, register <SEP> @dylanbitran  hit this link scroll down and read https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network <SEP> @dylanbitran its ethereum but deployed privately (not public blockchain) but you will see the components and their descriptions <SEP> thanks, yep i got it as you say the easiest way is google, reaserch, learn and try <SEP> but its just too much jajaja <SEP> oh, right you write laugh like hahah lol <SEP> @dylanbitran  you can deploy you solidity contracts with MIST <SEP> For developing apps/contracts I have used Visual Studio with the Solidity extension https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/96221853-33c4-4531-bdd5-d2ea5acc4799/

Just have to look for it. <SEP> I'm pretty sure I saw something that allows one to export a private key from Mist, using geth. Just have to look for it.  that would be new to me <SEP> @hegrz When you unlock your account, your private key is in the clear to sign things. One should be able to store it in plain text at that time. <SEP> @fjh1997 You should be able to import your Mist UTC keyfile directly into MyEtherWallet. <SEP> @phalexo yes, but there's no command to print it out in cleartext <SEP> Use this https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum
<SEP> hello <SEP> I'm trying to implement my own token but I would like to make a wallet to send and receive these tokens..are there implementations already such as mist? I just need a really simple one with just the ability to select the token before hand and just let the user send or recieve. It would be even better if you could tell me about an online implementation where people would't have to download the whole block <SEP> does google usually block the download of the claymore miner? <SEP> @evanstapler thats what the testnet/rosnet is for <SEP> @efootstep_team_twitter `geth` is not running or you are connecting on the wrong `geth.ipc` socket/pipe or a wrong port if running RPC interface. <SEP> quick question, is anyone concerned that the solidity guide is straightup copyrighted? <SEP> no creative commons license or share alike attribute or anything just copyrighted <SEP> @sambacha_twitter There will be two outcomes 1) Everyone will simply ignore your copyright 2) People will use resources not encumbered with legal headaches. <SEP> i know that but i think its kinda weird that it has one considering the framework behind crypto currency <SEP> i mean copyright works a little different for books, as long as you reference the original source you should be good as long as its not a straight plagiarism <SEP> Also, consider that you are likely to heavily lean on others to write this work. Do you intend to credit everyone for his contribution? <SEP> glad i dont have to answer that question :ok_hand: <SEP> There is a fair use doctrine in copyright law like being able to quote someone, but if something is a compilation of others' work, even with attribution it could be problematic. <SEP> the big thing here is at what level of success does it take for a law suit to make sense, some kid blogging and ripping off someones copyrighted book on android development vs a major website <SEP> anyways, anyone get a chance to check out the new Firefox 57? <SEP> holly shit is it an improvement over Chrome <SEP> I found what I didn't realize I sought. Y'all doing the good stuff. I get to see it happen! Awesome. Cool to be able to do that. <SEP> there is no explanation about testnet that is just for developer, i'm wasting time for today, terrible. <SEP> Any responsive website for reading etherum white paper <SEP> How  to  retrieve  ETH <SEP> @falehenrique I am here =) <SEP> Cause it doesn't output anything, it just says "pending..." in the console <SEP> @01GOD You are wasting your breath.

<SEP> Hello guys <SEP> I would like to know the security of the ethereum code <SEP> Any person with that information ? <SEP> Does anyone here think about trade finance application  to eliminate paper work based trade process <SEP> If there are some application on developing, I would be very interested
<SEP> You don't explain what you do at all. That's why it's scammy. <SEP> And the truth can be harsh <SEP> Use it to improve <SEP> And don't spam it here <SEP> And why is a "rise of nation" game on Ethereum, where ever minor thing costs money, and you need two different currencies <SEP> Tokens are to represent money. Where's the money in this? In effectively selling a fictional object? It's fictional lol. You'll never be able to program a fullly comprehensive contract to handle it without a simulator. That would cost too much gas. As Ethereum is public, anyone can just copy the data. Why pay for anything? <SEP> @VinothRajaJ_twitter To finish with what I was saying, you have a BIG perception problem - no one in their right mind EVEN if they 'get' your vision would invest in this - I am a mentor to startups and while I am in the U.S. where people invest and buy the stupidest stuff, this doesn't even feel/seem professional/serious. I'm ALL for innovation but there has to be some level of standard/professionalism here. Saying that you are an very early stage ICO isn't enough of a justification sorry to be direct. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Totally agree with your points
<SEP> HI <SEP> hellow <SEP> hello all join this telegram channel  https://t.me/pumptime1  there are Pump Every day + coins recommendations <SEP> Hi! I'm new here. <SEP> are there any GIS providers compatible with ethereum? <SEP> Just curious is this chat room decentralized too..? <SEP> bad joke I guess <SEP> hyy guys am new here please can someone help me ? <SEP> no body, that why we consider this coin a big shit. <SEP> hi, i ws wondering if there is any API available to convert amount of ether to corresponding USD <SEP> yes.. <SEP> hi. I have completed all downloads but still do not see the balance updated, please help <SEP> I am needy.. <SEP> All other coins have already grown almost x2. That shit from bottom $13.5 did x0. 71. Worst coin ever. Dropped from 37$ to13.5$ ruined me. Falling better than others coins, growing worse. Be damned the day when I bought ETC. Offer to delisting this Scam from all exchanges and forget about this shit. <SEP> Hi all , How to we measure security in the exchange platform ?
<SEP> link? <SEP> where to buy ether in GCC? <SEP> yes, got the password written down...but sadly it doesnt work <SEP> https://live.ether.camp <SEP> trying typos and all kinds of variations, just a few words separated by spaces <SEP> @haywirez check pm
<SEP> Dude. You wrote 2 pages of broken English. I'm just asking for mopre info <SEP> i made the point but because you didnt wish to see it for what it was but what you wanted it to be <SEP> lol <SEP> Because I have a lot of questions <SEP> at the end of the day the quantum computer is a lifestyle thats what people are missing about it <SEP> Just tell me what makes you able to do this <SEP> And not a random dreamer
<SEP> you will need to somehow track the time spent offchain and upload that to the chain <SEP> @jimthedev https://ens.codetract.io/ https://etherscan.io/ens?filter=auctionskn <SEP> how to secure ethereum wallet software because i cant see any security ,any one can open my wallet <SEP> u need a password to send a tx <SEP>  @wajdi_echi_twitter All wallet balances are public, in addition to you needing a password to send the transaction, as @qx133 stated :D <SEP> Also, I am a node developer. Anyone have a good video tutorial for getting started to developing on the blockchain? <SEP> if i deleted the software suddenly , i lose my money? <SEP> @wajdi_echi_twitter yes, thats why you need to backup your keyfile or seed. <SEP> @jimthedev videos might be outdated as things changes fast here. docs the way to go http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html <SEP> Is there a place where people go in the community to find contributors for existing projects? My guess is I could put some frontend PRs at least while I am learning. <SEP> So if you set the price low then you're optimizing for speed, setting high optimizes for money? <SEP> No setting high price costs you more Ether <SEP> oh ok. So if I want to set the price high, I need to buy ether to back it but I get more speed? <SEP> I want to understand that tradeoff more. <SEP> If you set a low gas price, you pay less Ether per gas but your transaction will take longer to propagate over the Ethereum network. If you set pay more Ether per gas, your transaction will propagate as soon as possible through the network.
<SEP> hey guys any news on ethereum? <SEP> When does the Rocket start going off!!!!! <SEP> Help Anyone? <SEP> I am here <SEP> well which platform are you using? <SEP> poloniex? <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> no, I just sent them from my mist wallet to Changelly, but 2 of the numbers were reversed, I tried to copy and paste but my Mist wallet wouldn't let me paste the address <SEP> I used the mist wallet because it was downloaded directly from the ethereum.org page and Felt that it would be the most secure. <SEP> Any advice on where to contact? <SEP> Hi. Can I get an answer to your question on transactions REP? <SEP> Hi, My issue ended up being a matter where Changelly received my money and posted it to an older order where the wallet address was identical other than 2 digits, so the transaction went through but on the order before. <SEP> Hey everyone! Would really appreciate some help. My chain data became corrupt with my Ethereum Wallet and I was forced to wipe the application and the data from my Mac. I have multiple copies of the chain data and keystore folders before the corruption took place. However, when I imported the keystore folder into a fresh install of Ethereum Wallet on another Mac, it was showing $0 Balance in my Wallet. <SEP> are your blocks up to date? <SEP> @stevenzeisler You have to sync up to the blockchain before you see your balance. 1.5 days. <SEP> @phalexo - thanks for the information! ok sounds good...I just wanted to make sure I was doing the process the right way by importing the UTC file <SEP> I am not 100% sure, but I would imagine since how else would It know what transactions have taken place to account for your balance. just my thought someone please correct me if I am incorrect in my assumption <SEP> @stevenzeisler Since you have a partial blockchain backup it should be a shorter process.
<SEP> @thekingturko you need a payable function <SEP> To handle incoming eth <SEP> And they do that so they can handle withdrawals. <SEP> I rather do eth bot as we make it more general purpose and I got rid of that idea. <SEP> Tyvm for the answer. So the first step will be to do a ico with a fixed price and sell the tokens. And the next step is to disable the payable function and the price will be regulated by the exchange right? <SEP> Sony work <SEP> *don't work off the contract balance <SEP> And correct <SEP> ``    function refund() public {         uint ethToRefund  = buyersEth <SEP> Because the owners take on eth <SEP> They pay the tokens out from a centralized wallet <SEP> Also, a token contract and ico contract should be separate <SEP> The second should end when the owner says so, sending all leftover tokens to the owner, or when its out <SEP> okay but they create one ICO contract to generate a total supply and send them in the constructor to the owner of the contract. and he send it to the other token contract?
<SEP> @bobsummerwill There should really be a link to the rooms somewhere stickied in here <SEP> https://gitter.im/orgs/ethereum/rooms <SEP> See also http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/introduction/community.html. <SEP> Yes, there should, @tjade273, maybe as part of the channel description. I don't think I can do that myself, though.   @alexvandesande should be able to when he returns. <SEP> what is the best place to go for questions about the json-rpc api
<SEP> I know where they were sent to Cryptopia but a newbe mistake caused them to  there but not in my wallet. I dont understand if I have the privet key why cant I access the blockchain and move them where ever I want? <SEP> I also would like to know where is the privet key stored? what file? and where? <SEP> You can contact us for any unconfirmed transaction for BLOCKCHAIN users only , please connect with us here by sending your transaction ID through direct message. or ltrh1508@gmail.com <SEP> @EthereumBTC_twitter  I heard you are a scam  and besides I or no one needs you to check a transaction on the blockchain they can do it them self with Ethereum Blockchain Exploror.
<SEP> @wildownes @bobsummerwill Whats the newbie ELI5 nutshell explanation of maidsafe and master coin? <SEP> but thats deff wrong <SEP> MasterCoin basically seemed to be a "tokens riding on top of Bitcoin" thing. <SEP> i think the main thing they trying to do is make a place you can put up a website that nobody can shut down <SEP> i think in free countries the privacy stuff isn't as exciting since we can pretty much put what we want up within reason <SEP> @bobsummerwill is there a file storage side to ethereum at all? <SEP> Well, by apps in MaidSafe, I don't mean applications for using MaidSafe, I mean actual dapps and smart contracts, which I don't think they are doing at all, are they?   It seems to be focussed purely on storing files and data, not on executable content. <SEP> RE:  File storage.    Yes.   Give me a second ... <SEP> i suspect it will be more client side web apps on maidsafe but right now they getting the storage and the data working.   who knows what the cost of storing will be... the talk of having a dropbox that pays for itself by sharing some of your hard disk is cool.... but that... they still working on <SEP> It's called Swarm (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOC45AgZG5Q) and has been in hibernation for the past few months but is under active development again now.    Lots of people are also using IPFS (https://ipfs.io) which fits with Ethereum very nicely, but unlike Swarm is actually already at a Beta stage and is live in the world.    IPFS is more like Bittorrent, though, in that it is a mechanism for getting files spread around the world, but without an incentive mechanism.   That means it will be fine for pirate videos, but maybe not so great for saving your family photos on.    Juan Benet, the lead for IPFS, is a real friend of the Ethereum community.   He spoke at that same DEVCON1 conference too.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewpIi1y_KDc <SEP> Viktor Tron just wrote this about Swarm vs IPFS: https://gist.github.com/zelig/954937b915768b8a8d2c
<SEP> Hey all, I'm on testnet.  I wanted to try out some development in solidity.  I've read about testnet mining and faucets to gain testnet ether.  However, neither seem to work.  Does anyone know of fastest way to get testnet ether?  Alternatively, does anyone have some testnet ether (even a little bit?) to spare?   0x5299a123C4FB5eFC5428f32AbA41Fa8B6d8C39fe <SEP> geth  geth.ipc keystore testnet <SEP> You can try to run the app again using command line and pass the flag `--rpc ~/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc ` <SEP> Olny had to set this when I changed my datadir <SEP> the command you used to get log.
<SEP> no, they don't let all account holders vote on where to spend my dollars based on how many bank tokens I have <SEP> yeah i guess not <SEP> Or if I put in 1 ETH and get 100 tokens, do my tokens accrue interest and become worth 1.5ETH over the next 4 days? <SEP> yeah the people sending money to banks get a way worse deal <SEP> umm, so, if I put 100 ETH in the dao, and people vote to fund a speculative startup, and I never see an ROI <SEP> i think the bank people got a better deal <SEP> I'm still curious what happens if I but 100 DAO (at 1.5ETH) on day 1 and then sell those 100 DAO on day 4. <SEP>  When someone fuels a DAO by sending it ETH during its Creation Phase, new DAO tokens are created in that moment. Those DAO tokens allow their holder to have complete control over the ETH in the DAO the created. That ETH can be withdrawn if the DAO Token Holder wants by splitting the DAO. Hopefully that explains why the terms "Token Sale"  and "crowdsale" don't fit.   The DAO Token Holders will use their tokens to vote on proposals. These proposals will be smart contracts that are accompanied by plain English descriptions of why the DAO should support their project (Explaining how the DAO profits by working with that Contractor).   Slock.it will follow this model, and we are almost ready to release our plain English proposal to build the Ethereum Computer and the Universal Sharing Network. We will release the it before the Creation of the DAO.   In summary the proposal will explain how we will build the Ethereum Computer to create a Universal Sharing Network that will Decentralize the Sharing Economy allowing trustless P2P exchanges of almost any item; how a small percentage of every exchange of value on that network will be sent to the DAO and how the DTHs will be able to claim their fair portion of this reward. <SEP> you cant move tokens until after the creation phase is over <SEP> The model is obviously designed to make a successful crowdsale.  You'll probably raise $5-10M <SEP> so unless you want to find someone to sell your private keys to, you will have to wait until after the creation phase <SEP> and the price of DAO tokens will probably go up initially <SEP> well thats great for the DAO <SEP> And they can accept other people's proposals too <SEP> i guess, but it's bad if thousands of unaccredited investors lose millions of dollars in a speculative investment. <SEP> and it's bad for the future of decentralized autonomous organizations if this one is a big failure
<SEP> Hi <SEP> Hi Guys, where can I buy ripio credit, I'm pretty new here sorry <SEP> How can i access my ETH? i sent from Lykke (broker) as a smart contract to BITFINEX (broker) who are normal brokers.  For some reason i had been sending ETH before, so assumed it was Lykke.  Was told BF dont accept smart contract sent ETH.  The records show the ETH is sitting in the bitfinex receiving address.  BF have not responded.  seems normal as some said they didnt get a reply for 2 months.    Q. How can i get the ETH.  Its stuck in an incompatable address now.  Seems ethereum never made the system smart enough to say oooops the wallet is incomtable, return to sender. <SEP> Q. how can i send or receive a ETH using  API or library in c# ?? <SEP> how can i buy a eth <SEP> ?
<SEP> Hello, I'm looking into the current situation with regards to Ethereum trade and HF <SEP> what is an appropriate channel for that? <SEP> i.e. for trading/exchange related things <SEP> Should we make one in here? <SEP> We should probably put it on the ethereum.org site so they can avoid liabilities <SEP> makes sense to me. I'm relatively new to communicating with ethereum, although I've been reading all along <SEP> I assume if people think they are tricked into mining something that isnt the original ethereum they might sue. <SEP> I'm on the exchange services side, and considering whether to list ETH and how to treat ETC <SEP> I have been with Ethereum just lurking and testing stuff since 2014 <SEP> not part of any official effort <SEP> @benjyz I don't believe there is a channel for ETH-F vs ETH-C at the moment, though this isn't the right channel either.  There is a reddit community for ETH-C and since they are the underdogs at the moment in this race I suspect you would find them to be a more helpful audience for information on how to trade both ETH-F and ETH-C on your exchange. <SEP> there is no public channel for trading and exchange info? <SEP> as far as I'm aware there is/was some coordination with exchanges <SEP> You do have to be careful trading either at the moment.  If you don't account for the two chains you can easily screw yourself or your users, even if you only trade one of the chains. (due to replay attacks) <SEP> yes, that is exactly the issue I want to address <SEP> since ETC price is not 0, it means that ETH needs two listings: pre and post HF <SEP> Reddit may be your best bet, I don't think there are any chat channels here that are really a good place to discuss that. <SEP> discussing hard-forks and how to preserve value - no channel for that? That would be strange <SEP> I don't run things, but I don't believe there is any chat channel for this at the moment (I agree, there should be). <SEP> @Zoltu the thing is that exchanges are kind of forced to coordinate or risk some issues. seems some exchanges haven't followed EF advice and listed ETC anyway <SEP> At the core, your exchange just needs to make sure it has separate accounts for each of the chains.  You can do an additional service to your users by auto-replaying any transactions on both chains and issuing users a refund on the chain they didn't mean to trade on.  I don't know if any exchanges do this now but it could set yours apart as being more "user-friendly". <SEP> @benjyz Yep, I recognize the problem here.  Maybe there is some documentation or discussion somewhere I don't know about though? <SEP> :+1: <SEP> @bobsummerwill There may be value in spinning up a Gitter channel here so we have a place to redirect users who want to talk about this stuff to that is "real-time" rather than forum based. <SEP> @Zoltu interesting suggestion. I'm first concerned with the ETH pre-/post fork valuation. ETH is currently split into two: ETH pre and post HF <SEP> @bobsummerwill its an involved technical issue <SEP> Is it that bad you had to remove the downvote feature? <SEP> None the less, they may be able to redirect you.  /shrug <SEP> but surely the big exchanges are already in contact with eth devs? <SEP> I doubt exchanges are able to handle it on their own. <SEP> I suspect the big exchanges have at least one technical person that follows one or more of the Ethereum tech channels and/or research channels. <SEP> for example splitting accounts, as you described etc. <SEP> e.g., go-ethereum if they are leveraging the go client, or EthereumJ. <SEP> well, it is a kind of general fungibilty issue as well <SEP> I know how to do that from following the research channel, but that isn't the right place to talk about it either. <SEP> new channel +1, if it make sense <SEP> oh, didn't know that. is the CPP much less active? I prefer go <SEP> thanks @bobsummerwill @Zoltu <SEP> @bobsummerwill   just went to the link, i was there before actually but i guess i ended up here because i didn't see anyone over there <SEP> I may be missing something, but I always got the impression that EthereumJ was built more as a library while geth was built as an application.
<SEP> monero ++ <SEP> don't buy stuff without codebase <SEP> without working tech <SEP> like EOS <SEP> ohh <SEP> hmmm <SEP> haha <SEP> horseracing made me much money <SEP> doesn't mean my winning horse has good technoligy <SEP> EOS's tech is the best so far <SEP>  i am going to invest EOS <SEP> EOS doesn't even have tech yet <SEP> are you kidding me? <SEP> and the fact that you don't know that... <SEP> they basically developed an operating system running on blockchain <SEP> show me EOS main/testnet <SEP> they are doing big marketing <SEP> could have showed you that last year <SEP> as Tron, ADA etc <SEP> you can't they have no working product <SEP> im actually developing on EOS <SEP> show me <SEP> webassembly is pretty nice <SEP> lol why should i show you? <SEP> https://github.com/dondre <SEP> show me <SEP> if you say EOS has a working product you are a liar or just a shill <SEP> how you know <SEP> see, now you have me trolling too <SEP> just flaming? <SEP> @Hovoaslanian you see, everybody has his own opinion and everybody thinks his own is the most sophisticated <SEP> that's why you need to do your own research <SEP> otherwise you will just run behind hypes <SEP> never said that <SEP> all i said was.. if your trying to make real money.. get in at the ground floor <SEP> which is common sense <SEP> other factors apply, we all know that.. but
<SEP> hi <SEP> so i have succesfully installed ethereum on windows 10, bought 1 ether using bitcoin and now what ?

<SEP> Hey everyone.. How much work would it really take for a company like Alibaba to pivot to BlockChain technology? <SEP> I am working on a BlockChain based platform which would create an open marketplace for businesses but concerned about competition from Amazon and Alibaba. With their platforms being central server based I can't imagine that they can pivot to BlockChain easily but I am not a developer hence my question <SEP> hello ,  what is the type of algorithm used by the ethereum ? thanks <SEP> @rtm226_twitter: My experience with established companies and the blockchain is that they usually don't embrace it, ( else banks would be flocking to it). The reason could be that at the top there is usually a CEO and board whose main job is to  keep the business going in a smooth way, so they might perceive it as a risk. I am not sure about your project, but I believe that if it something you feel passionate about you  should do it. <SEP> @KenoLeon thank you for the quick reply. Definately something I am passionate about and we are working on but since the concept is similiar to that of Alibaba and Amazon wanted to see from a coding/developer perspective how difficult or easy it would be to pivot <SEP> I did not think it would be easy and since we are a startup could give us a huge first mover competitive advantage being a BlockChain based company.. The future is moving to BlockChain just a matter of time <SEP> also @KenoLeon  if interested I can send you some more info on the project <SEP> Hey Buddy! Check this out to get started on the spec. address An Ethereum address represents an account. For EOA, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account, e.g., cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826. This is a hexadecimal format (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by appending 0x to the address. Web3.js and console functions accept addresses with or without this prefix but for transparency we encourage their use. Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is 42 characters long. Several apps and APIs are also meant to implement the new checksum-enabled address scheme introduced in the Mist Ethereum wallet as of version 0.5.0. <SEP> remember you're building a Dapp on an existing blockchain. DOn't over complicate it. :)) <SEP> And don't use javascript. Ue go or c. If you have to use Electron, hide your Node S <SEP> Hey ghviop88. it's https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining <SEP> know all these words. Gas, Gas Price, bla bla bla... block chains evolve. When was the last time you mined a bitcoin? http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/glossary.html

<SEP> Hello <SEP> at 2016 i started to mine ethereum in my office and everything was on my coinomy wallet <SEP> At 2017 i was driving and the window was open <SEP> My phone suddenly fell out of my car and broke hard <SEP> In those days I wasn't very accurate person and I relied on my phone <SEP> And after the accident I lost everything and couldn't access my wallet because I didn't have anything from my wallet <SEP> I have tried a lot of ways to fix my Samsung phone but no one can help me and everybody says to say goodbye to your phone because it damaged very bad <SEP> What should I do? <SEP> Because i dont have my recovery phrase and i cant access my device <SEP> I sent this message to coinomi : <SEP> I decided some days ago to try for my Etherium too It is not fair  I had trust in you when everybody said do not trust cryptocurrency and wallets I had trusted to etherium when everybody was selling it I tried to mine It I tried to mine it and hold it in your wallet   I had around 3 bitcoin in my Binance account One day I sent 700$ bitcoin to a wrong Id address  I tried to connect them and day propose me a little money for using their bot to search their blocks and servers and finally, after 1 weak they found it and took it back to me it is no privacy when I can't access my money; what is the difference between it or stealing my money by theft because of week privacy  When I say I didnt join my wallet in late of 2017 or early 2018 It is the right clue and it showed im saying right because I'm the owner of it and I didn't join it from that time because I couldn't  The next clue is that most of my wallet is filled with etherium or perhaps off it  It is not private if you cant access to wallets  Because first of all, I had trust in you then I sent all my miner profit to your wallet  I'm young and I invested most of my money in mining it is not fair if I can't access to it   Secondly, I sent my broken phone to you, you can check if your wallet save device models when I was going to your wallet by it  You know, I had my recovery phrase But unfortunately I kept codes to my phone and when that accident happened  i lost everything <SEP> And they just answered me : <SEP> Coinomi has zero access to your coins / funds <SEP> You cannot restore without the phrase <SEP> Always - I repeat: always - make sure you secure any seed phrase for a wallet on either a second device/machine or even better on paper that it stored in a secure location, separate from your device(s) so it can even be recovered in case your apartment etc. burns down. <SEP> With a seed phrase or other "wallet backup" your wallet contents are irretrievably lost when you lose or break the device containing the phrase <SEP> @ghost~604414de6da037398465c4bd: in your case, one thing that could in theory still work is to retrieve the data off the storage chip of the phone, for which you usually need to hire an expert <SEP> depending on how much value is on that wallet, you can decide if that is economically worth it <SEP> These fake stories look like "I had a $100 in my back pocket, really I did. And a strong gust of wind just blew my $100 out of my pocket, and into the sewer. Since it was raining, my $100 must have been flushed all the way down to the ocean. It is so very unfair that I don't have my $100 anymore." <SEP> Hello, a fundamental barrier to scientific progress in academia is having to seek funding through centralized grant agencies. Additionally it is slowed by centralized publishing. In short, I am using create-eth-app + truffle + react-app + ganache to develop an searchable environment (app name: dFund) for scientist to propose individual experiments (ie ethereum wallets)  with the experimental details, cost, and agreement to load data _back into the blockchain_, outlined in smart contracts. Then the people, in the same environment, can choose to fund ethereum wallets containing smart contract experiment experiments worth conducting.  The problem is I am a biochemist (I work at hopkins in baltimore, USA) and I do not know squat about coding and am learning on the fly and would love some advice on how to deploy a dApp after it is developed. My email is mmhurley513@gmail.com, if this interests you and you know whats up with web3 please reach out! <SEP> I think a big part that I am not emphasizing is the burden on the scientist to load the data from the 'ethereum funded' experiment back into the block chain. This way the results would be saved and distributed, no reason to involve centralized publication services as well. <SEP> Distributed to whom? The key part is to publicize the findings so that those who would be interested pay attention. Just because you load something into the chain  does not mean anyone will look or care. <SEP> @phalexo: By loading data back into the smart contract that funded the experiment, to my limited understanding, would distribute the data amongst those involved with the contract. That is what I mean by distributed. Perhaps part of every smart contract would be to load a manuscript to the open source archive  (maybe you could make the website accessable by QR code) <SEP> www.biorxiv.org is an example. This way the data could be more widely accessible, but its authenticity and immediate distribution can be done with the smart contract in the dApp. <SEP> A smart contract does not actively "distribute" anything. You would need a program that runs outside the chain to query for data, it is all transaction based. Your contributors would have to query the chain. It is not clear why you need the blockchain. <SEP> Companies like Patreon,   and others cater to content producers, and your supporters can donate to your research if you can convince them to do so. <SEP> anyone wanna sell me ropsten ETH? <SEP> $1/ETH i'll buy 100
<SEP> hi <SEP> Hello Supporters, Can anyone tell me if it is possible to have 9 million plus circulating and only 34 dollars in volume as in ITT? <SEP> try coinbase <SEP> never mind it was 24 hour mark <SEP> Where would I find the global ethereum log? <SEP> if you join this site, it shows a great detail of the world trade of every major currency. Feel free to use my referral, if not that is okay :) https://www.binance.com/?ref=11388715 <SEP> It is a threat to them in way, however, these cryptocurrencies are running to become even more and more encrypted and rather harder to shut it off. The central bank would need to have official signing by each country's president/king/queen to ban these currencies and that's highly unlikely in the U.S. since we are pushing for a NSA free internet and surfing independency. The central bank can make a smarter move and start collaborating with these currencies and start buying them to have higher control over the market regardless of how none materialistic it is. It is a rather very complicated and a challenge to cyber security experts to contain such amount of coins. Only time would tell <SEP> kraken.com <SEP> Hello everyone! I was wondering if it is possible to make your own Ethereum wallet within an application. <SEP> (It is for iOS) <SEP> `OptimusPrime` pfff <SEP> `OptimusPrime` boring <SEP> `OptimusPrime` everyone wants to launch an ICO <SEP> `OptimusPrime` nobody talks about shit <SEP> `OptimusPrime` I am sure there are some really talented people here <SEP> `OptimusPrime` but fuck man.. so boring guys. <SEP> what can be wrong on my end if integration tests( https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/master/tests ) for go-ethereum fails. <SEP> unconvertable

I can put one together. I have got soft commitment funding from a crypto corp. This space is growing. Ted T networks had a special team called the advanced marketing group who "were" going to put up crypto shows on TV, other networks were involved. It's just sitting doing nothing. For some reason, crypto corps are not adopting this form of media. That is understandable but to grow this exponentially and have the "people" benefit vs. banks,etc. is going to require dissemination of information on a global scale using every possible method of communication. <SEP> The crypto corp. is going to pay to have this show on TV. The hard part is getting past the networks.

<SEP> alguien habla espanol <SEP> my wallet was stuck 158 blocks away from finishing.  restarted, and now it shows 11 peers and 0 block.  its just been sitting like this for a few hours.  any ideas? <SEP> Hello guys. I'm trying to download ethereum blockchain in a reasonable format (not-binary) It seems like the only client capable of this is cpp-ethereum, I tired purity, but it seems from the sources (couldn't find any docs on this), that the only formats supported are binary and hex. (I can't find a spec of the last one, so still tried to go with cpp-ethereum's json) <SEP> But, here is the problem - I can't install it on ubuntu 17.10 :) <SEP> i want to buy some cryptocurrency can some 1 tell me what is the best
<SEP> new to ethereum and testing the token/contract on test.net.  I see that you need at least 1 ether to get started. How do I update my acct to enable this? Is it possible on test.net? <SEP> @Mottu88 are you on a private testnet or public? <SEP> mmm Start mining is grayed out though.  I'm on El Capitan ..should work right? I saw that the IDE is not ready yet for it.

If I see you on another forum announcing your stuff, I'll join in. Will I be just as cynical? Yes. Even if I'm rested? Yes. <SEP> @metabol then advertise and make claims them <SEP> *claims then <SEP> Haha ok...Just keep your eyes open... <SEP> And a properly secured server wouldn't have mishaps.

<SEP> You don't explain what you do at all. That's why it's scammy. <SEP> And the truth can be harsh <SEP> Use it to improve <SEP> And don't spam it here <SEP> And why is a "rise of nation" game on Ethereum, where ever minor thing costs money, and you need two different currencies <SEP> Tokens are to represent money. Where's the money in this? In effectively selling a fictional object? It's fictional lol. You'll never be able to program a fullly comprehensive contract to handle it without a simulator. That would cost too much gas. As Ethereum is public, anyone can just copy the data. Why pay for anything? <SEP> @VinothRajaJ_twitter To finish with what I was saying, you have a BIG perception problem - no one in their right mind EVEN if they 'get' your vision would invest in this - I am a mentor to startups and while I am in the U.S. where people invest and buy the stupidest stuff, this doesn't even feel/seem professional/serious. I'm ALL for innovation but there has to be some level of standard/professionalism here.

<SEP> hello, how to know for which token i got authorized to spend? <SEP> @minnuriouiio allowance(X) <SEP> It will return how much you're allowed to spend from X account. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  but it will ask for the _owner . how to find that? :D <SEP> ... someone will only cause allowance if they know you. You should know if they call it. <SEP> OR you should expect it, and it will fail. That's the smart contract version. You allow a contract to spend X. They try it. It knows if it succeeds or fails. <SEP> TBH, that's why that call exists. Smart Contracts. <SEP> how about getting all the "input" data to contract and scan it for my address? <SEP> But you can also track the event history of the contract <SEP> if i try i, then i need to spend gas to check weather it works or not.. <SEP> But people won't randomly allow it lol. <SEP> No <SEP> Use call instead of creating a TX <SEP> Event history. Calling allowance. <SEP> @kayabaNerve thanks.. i'll go with the event tx.. <SEP> @kayabaNerve thank you :D <SEP> Happy to help <SEP> @PAWAN37160671_twitter what's up <SEP> Need to build a server in the environment of Ethereum? <SEP> @0824snails What? <SEP> Sorry, maybe my question is wrong. I mean whether I need a server when I build ethereum in my computer.If this question is clownish,  please ignore it. @kayabaNerve <SEP> @0824snails You don't need a server to build Ethereum. If you run a public node, your computer becomes a server. <SEP> You do need access to a node to talk with contracts. <SEP> @kayabaNerve OK, thank you.
<SEP> Hi....is it necessary to download the whole etherum wallet to make new contracts?

However, I'll share why... :smiley_cat:   Fyi, we continuously undertake technical-evaluation of the eco-systems (ex : BTC, Ethereum, Quorum, etc) to establish acceptable-use of a Smart Contract. One  concept/prototype is on a Taxation Systems (Government) where a Smart-Contract is establish between the TaxAuthority and TaxPayer; thus enabling both to commit transaction based on a Smart-Contract parameters that would trigger collections & refunds.  Reason for sharing the above is - our prototype seems to have few similarities with your inquiry. Some briefs: - `Cross-chain model` Smart Contract between the Party A (TaxAuthority) and party B (TaxPayer), - Pre-Defined Smart-Contract/Wallet between Party A and Party B, - Wallet for ID's, funds (for collection/refund triggered by mutually/consensus-agreed tax parameters), -  Protocols of one-time-only event between Party A and Party B, - Will not recognize transaction by Party A or Party B not complying the parameters (thus giving controls to both the TaxAuthority and TaxPayer to ignore triggers for collection or refund), - A gas-share is defined by incentives given by the TaxAuthority to the TaxPayer thru a conditional-triggers (as attraction b'coz TaxPayer would want to pay anything extra right? :smile: ) - Any stray-transaction will go to the TaxAuthority coffers :worried:   As these are prototypes, I'm still 'not that' ready to commercialize the work to avoid escalation of issues. From our R&D stage, we are more driven with a mature PoS stage  i.e. security, centralization risk, energy efficiency (due to numerous issues with PoW and as some eco-systems is yet 'maturely/fully-PoS'.)  p/s : Also fyi, we work extensively as technology-enabler environment (and less on ICOs, currencies-related). :smile: If need be, do PM for updates. <SEP> NOVA ICO COM BONUS DE 25 MOEDAS NA INSCRUCAO. <SEP>  https://www.affiliatecoin.io?ref=aff24c00-8797-42bd-9022-1c1e11b57e1c

<SEP> Hi all someone stoll OMG tokens from my wallet can i get some help? PLEASE <SEP> @maurice2peter_twitter If they were sent out of your wallet, you're screwed. <SEP> Ethereum transactions can't be reversed like Paypal. <SEP> The best thing to do would be to learn that you need to step up your security. <SEP> Maybe look into 2FA, use trustworthy services... If you're hosting Geth/Parity yourself, make sure you don't have any open ports.
<SEP> anyone familiar with evm, why almost all contracts start with mstore(60,40)? <SEP> The free memory pointer is at 0x40 and 0x60 is the first free memory slot for a fresh mem pool <SEP> so this 60 tells the rest of the code: feel free to use first 96 bytes or use after 96th byte? <SEP> is it completely necessary? i don't see it used in my demo contracts, or like a tradition? <SEP> It's necessary <SEP> The first 64 bytes are scratch space for the evm to use <SEP> The next 32 is the pointer <SEP> After 96 is yours <SEP> sounds good. Any new doc on full opcode specification outside of maths from yellow paper? <SEP> especially arguments definition are lacking e.g. codecopy(a,b,c) <SEP> Yes, go to the inline assembly section of Solidity and you should find what you're looking for <SEP> Not opcode <SEP> But close to it

I have no idea where the wrong address comes from. I think it was modified by coinexchange <SEP> @legendarchery_twitter Well, how different is the address from the one you wanted to use? Anything is possible of course, but I would doubt that an exchange would undermine their own business to do this. <SEP> @phalexo  coinexchange told me to contact a dev and that someone might be able to help me recover the funds. is there a way or not at all ? <SEP> @phalexo  I entered my address :  0x3cAbb0ebbf41bac723072b17b998DCe18002e5dA but it  was sent to a  : 0x3cabb8dce18002e5da0ebbf41bac723072b17b99 <SEP> @legendarchery_twitter Almost certain they lied. <SEP> @phalexo I m not saying they did it on purpose but how could I enter an actually working address ? what are the chances of doing that ? <SEP> @phalexo the wrong address is a mix of the correct one <SEP> I think you pasted twice. <SEP> @phalexo so these ETH will stay there in oblivion in a wallet that belongs  to nobody? <SEP> Unless there is a drastic rework in how things are governed, yes, it's a black hole. <SEP> @phalexo all right, thx <SEP> Hopefully it was not too much. <SEP> @phalexo 2.5 ETH <SEP> Consider yourself blessed it was not 500 ether like the other guy.

But i need to do some commanding and im far from tech-savvy <SEP> Ill try to import in on a PC. Otherwise ill wait, like u say its safe enough in the pre-sale. <SEP> Does it matter if i try to import the backup or the adress-json? Are they the same? <SEP> And i should tell you that im really greatfull that i can get such good support so fast. U are doing a really good job man.

<SEP> Hi i just started checking ethereum and i want to learn everything as possible about it.

<SEP> how can i start mining ethereum <SEP> I know this chat room isn't all that active but I'd like to get in contact with the Ethereum Foundation. I emailed the contact address on their site multiple times and haven't received a reply. If anyone could help I'd greatly appreciate it. <SEP> I need to know about ethereum <SEP> more information please help me <SEP> when is proof of stake and how many ethers do i need to stake, and how much eth would i earn? <SEP> why ether value get down? <SEP> @AbdulRaufAwan17_twitter  choose between all the available eth protocol compliant software: i recommend go-ethereum or cpp-ethereum. You have to compile it (I only work with linux so there might exist a GUI version of these for linux and windows) and after compiling it you should try and run geth , starting a full node. You have to configure some things, as the genesis file but i think go-ethereum already provides a default genesis config.  You need to set up your coinbase address. it's your first address being created and will receive the coins.   it is fairly easy. you should get the idea of how it goes, now search for a tutorial.

They will tell you how to access your EOS in the mainnet EOS chain. They have locked the EOS tokens they distributed on Ethereum forever. <SEP> Don't fall for scams.

<SEP> I purchased  ZRX from Binance 22 days ago, but when I went to my Ethereum Ledger Wallet, it doesn't show up.  That is the address I used to transfer it to, but some how it is showing up at Etherscan.  Can someone explain this to me and how I get access to those coins? <SEP> Are you running a local node like Ethereum Wallet, Mist, Parity, etc? <SEP> Yes through my Ledger Nano S <SEP> I never signed up for Etherscan, but it seems Binance moved it there. <SEP> The Ledger Nano is not a node, it is only a hardware device to generate and store keys, It does not interact with the blockchain directly. Etherscan also does not own or hold any funds. They are a Block explorer, a utility website to let you see the contents of the blockchain without running a node. <SEP> What application is interacting/interfacing with your Ledger device? <SEP>   I don't know. <SEP> Binance is who I purchased through  and i am new to this <SEP> Mac or PC? <SEP> PC <SEP> I go through Chrome <SEP> Thank for answering me so quicly Geoffrey <SEP> So you are using this? https://www.ledgerwallet.com/apps/ethereum <SEP> No I have cold storage if that is what you are asking.  I have never gone directly there. <SEP> The interfact you are using looks like those in the screenshots <SEP> ? <SEP> Yes, I have actually print out the activity <SEP> I went to the page and yes that is where I setup my Ledger Nano S Wallets <SEP> But when I plug in my Nano and key in my password, etc. it shows ethereum empty <SEP> I am not sure what the data source (the node it uses to get information about the blockchain) but if your balance in correct on etherscan then that is most likely correct <SEP> The balance is correct, but how do I get access to it <SEP> In other words if I wanted to sell how do get back to sell <SEP> Ahhh, this is the 0x Token <SEP> Yes it is <SEP> Sorry, you did mention that I should have read your message more closely <SEP> Not that I would sell now with the loss, I would wait <SEP> No problem, does it make a difference? <SEP> Tokens are a kind of meta coin, built on top of the network. A contract manages the records of who owns what so they are never really sent to your address, instead your access has the rights to tell the contract what to do with the tokens it thinks you own. <SEP> your address has the rights* <SEP> https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005197845-I-don-t-find-my-ERC20-tokens-on-my-Ledger-device <SEP> Looks like you need to use another app to handle tokens. That link coins a tutorial on how to do it. <SEP> Thank you so much Geoffrey.  I really appreciate your help. <SEP> Not a problem, Dont risk more then you can afford to loose :) <SEP> Geoffrey, I downloaded MyEtherWallet on my desk top and that is what I go and what you are saying is I must give an address? <SEP> I know that.  My husband is doing this and I am the computer side of it since I retired from Intel <SEP> https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005200009 contains screen shots and a breakdown of the steps you need to follow <SEP> ok <SEP> I will do this and see how well I do and you can help someone else. <SEP> There is no one else at the min, besides 90% of it is

<SEP> Hello,  When I am trying to send ethers from my wallet it says wrong password. I am 95% sure that I have entered the right password but it says it isnt. I have another account there with the same password and it works well. Any ideas? Is there any possibility to reset/recover my password? I am using the latest version of mist wallet  I have restarted multiple times and I can send Ethers from my other accounts which are in the same wallet. So it really seems to be that my password is incorrect. And I have no idea what is it then if its not the one I use "always". So is there any possibilities to recover/reset my password? <SEP> I would really appreciate if someone could answer me! <SEP> I am using latest version of Mist wallet <SEP> You can't reset/recover your password <SEP> @wallethelp its not your password its a wallet bug <SEP> I am having issues dragging my pre-sale .json file to the "drop pre-sale file" blue dotted box. Any reason why? <SEP> Thank you @maran and @alexvandesande  I guess there is nothing I can do but wait for a new release? :)
<SEP> I am trying to download the wallet app mist. But I am getting this error message: <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> Dont worry.

Anyone know if it's normal that to install the Ethereum wallet the program stays more that two days downloading? To syncro? Good morning!!! <SEP> @PopunderTraffic_twitter Hi! You try to download the ethereum wallet to start the token building? <SEP> ok once we download the ETH wallet, then whats the next step? <SEP> @PopunderTraffic_twitter Go his page: https://ethereum.org/token <SEP> this is in which programming language? which backend programmer i need to hire for this <SEP> @PopunderTraffic_twitter I have a video tutorial in spanish that shows you how to make your own cryptocurrency with this page, the ethereum/token page... If you want I can translate the video and help to you to make your coin... Only want that you pay me with your new coins... :) Hahahaha...

I had my hard drive wiped and lost my account info on mist.  is there anyway I can import my account again without the key? or is there a way to find my key? <SEP> Hi all, I work for a company developing an ICO. I'm the chief developer so I'm looking at learning Solidity myself. In the mean time we got a quote for $40,000 and 4% of the ICO proceeds just for writing the contract. This seems steep, to put it politely. This may be a gold rush thing where people throw money at it, I don't know. Thoughts? <SEP> @johnmott59 My thought is you being in the USA need to think about avoiding federal penitentiary . The SEC just filed charges against a real estate related company and closed down their ICO. You'd need to consult a securities attorney whether or not your token/coin would be a security. p.s. How complicated is your contract? Is  it just a regular token to represent shares? <SEP> thank you, our ICO is a utility token and we have securities attorneys to help us out . we have a clear utility token use case, the token represents a value from earned activity without an expectation of value increase. <SEP> I think the contract should be a straightforward crowd sale but there is a distance between 'think' and 'reality' ;-) <SEP> I don't want to over think it but at the same time don't want to step onto a land mine because something wasn't properly coded. <SEP> @johnmott59 Sounds like you'd need some kind of mining functionality. The fact of life is you will make mistakes, i.e. need some means to upgrade your contract, i.e. use of router contracts, some other forms of upgradeable contracts. <SEP> I downloaded the Ethereum Wallet and sent 42 ETH to wallet.  Then I sent 5 ETH to Cobinhood.com to invest in ICO.  Cobinhood never accepted the transfer because I "did not have sufficient gas".  However the 5 ETH were never returned to my wallet.  And I have not been able to get a response from Ethereum Wallet support for 5 days. Who can help me? <SEP> There is no "Ethereum Wallet" support. It is not a company. <SEP> The earned value will occur outside of ethereum, the tokens are a form of payment so i don't think we need to mine. I agree about mistakes, etc, which is why we wanted to get some one that had done it once or twice. I think this is a no-brainer $200-300hr software work but can't see $40,000 and certainly can't see a percentage outside of a bonus perhaps. Am I off the mark here on the amount of software work required? <SEP> @johnmott59 Well, I know that the going price to audit someone else's contract for security and efficiency, etc... is about $30K.  One can slap together something  from all the code floating around, if you know what to slap together.  It might take a good engineer about 2 months to get the ropes. If you are a total genius,  maybe 6 weeks. How much do you get paid to be the chief developer per month? Do the math. Whoever might be willing to work for you can just as easily spend his time on his own project. I am developing two things , for example. <SEP> fair enough. You do pay a premium for someone else's learning time, and I respect that. Just didn't have a sense of the scope of numbers. <SEP> @johnmott59 I agree, however, that 4% of an ICO is outrageous. :-) <SEP> @johnmott59  it doesnt take 2 months ...neither 6 weeks, where do u get those numbers <SEP> I didn't propose the time frames for development. <SEP> i wrote mine in 15 minutes... @johnmott59 <SEP> @ingamx Certainly not from you. Are you still  looking for developers to work for free for you? <SEP> an ICO contract? <SEP> yes <SEP> @phalexo  yes, but not for ICO copntracts

I have setup a private network.. and i have 1 miner in the network.. since the time it started, it has been mining several blocks, while I have **not** made any **transactions**! What are these blocks? what is it mining? <SEP> @arunnalpet a new block gets mined once your miner solved the hash puzzle <SEP> doesn't matter if there are transactions to contain in that block <SEP> empty blocks are blocks too <SEP> oh wow! this is something i dint know! I thought blocks are created only when there are transactions..  thank you very much for your response @sh4d0v1 <SEP> here to help <SEP> so.. doesnt the ledger size keep increasing if it keeps mining? <SEP> yes, a blockchain's size  will always increase with time <SEP> okay.. thanks!

Then a minute or so later it'll be in your account. <SEP> So if you have some BTC, for example, you would create an Ethereum account via Mist or an online wallet, then create a Poloniex account, send the BTC to your Poloniex account, then trade it for Ethereum, then send the Ethereum in your Poloniex account to your Ethereum account. <SEP> I,  want to create an exchange,  i see that when i send eth to poloniex it receives in my wallet then transfer to the cold wallet

<SEP> How can i download ethereum wallet without it taking 2 weeks? <SEP> `Quiark` Astroaffair, I found Parity much faster. Not sure if it works with the GUI tho.

<SEP> does anybody know where to talk about #ens ? <SEP> @impactsoft88_twitter "monthly returns from 15% to 25% of your portfolio" sounds like  ponzi to me <SEP> Hi guys. I am rather new here and juts trying Ethereum at the moment. I had downloaded the Wallet from the Ethereum org. web site and seems it#s synchronized fully yesterday after some days of stack and reloading/deleting chaindata/ and a lot of other suggestions from other forumes. Now today I open Ethereum App again and see message in red that ''last block was synchronized a year ago''. Then it started to synchronize (getting some blocks again). But again very-very slow. I see from 8 to 10 peers now but still progress is very bad. Just wondering if it has to be synchronized 100% again (and each time?) to get Ethers to the Wallet from my Ether account? It happen last week (during trial purchase of Ether) that I saw Ethers on my account through Etherscan system but didn't see it in my Wallet. Can somebody help to clarify it to me before I take a decision to purchase more Ethers? I know maybe for you it seems rather easy but for non IT guy it's rather complicated and I need some level of confidence in Wallet usage to not lost it.  Thanks in advance. <SEP> @robipuha_twitter you dont have to sync the hole chain from scratch every time. The client only syncs the block it hasnt already processed. You were probably never fully synced or you were synced to the testnet or you startet your client in testnet.  I know having a synced full node is difficult. Perhaps you can try starting the client in light mode. <SEP> Thanks for quick answer.  I am surprised to get it so quick as last week I haven't got any feedback for days !!!! No, actually, I always tried with main network.  I never started the client in testnet. How to start the client in light mode? Is it normal that each time I open the App it's show me how many blocks left (and %)? I am also wondering if I was fully synchronized or not? How to check it? Thanks.

My research has shown me that Im looking for a wallet with the following capabilities:   A user controls the private keys  A user can send 0 ETH transactions A user can set custom gas levels or your wallet automatically sets the gas level appropriately.  I was wondering if your wallet would be appropriate for this use? If not, what errors would I encounter that would not make your wallet a good one for use for my Prism? If your wallet would not work with Prism at this time and you planning any changes when do you think I could expect to see them?  Thanks for your time and attention.

<SEP> Hi guys, I am willing to register contracts in a blockchain. I understand we can rely on Ethereum blockchain protocol to do it. Anyone could briefly explain me how to make it happen please? Many thanks in advance. Best <SEP> what do you mean by "register contracts" <SEP> I need to create an authenticity structure for contracts (agreement between 2 individuals) <SEP> my idea is to encode videos or notes and to place them into a blockchain and that in order to prove their authenticity in the future. <SEP> I have a web app coded in ruby on rails. In my Create protocol I would like to use Ethereum platform. <SEP> does what I say make sense? <SEP> You don't want to store big data like videos on the blockchain as it is too expensive <SEP> typically you store big data outside of blockchain but store the hash of the data in blockchain to verify integrity <SEP> i don't know of any ruby ethereum libraries <SEP> so you may need to code against the HTTP/JSON interface <SEP> or use some other back end tech <SEP> In the opinion of the group which is the best mobile ETH wallet for iPhone? <SEP> Thanks @chafey
<SEP> Newbie question, but I have been a software developer for 17 years...Whats the best way to create a wallet? Any gotchas? <SEP> use geth or one of the GUIs <SEP> which are Mist/Ethereum Wallet, parity <SEP> there also are third party wallets which allow a light wallet but ... you know, third party risks <SEP> where are the returns coming from?
<SEP> You don't explain what you do at all. That's why it's scammy. <SEP> And the truth can be harsh <SEP> Use it to improve <SEP> And don't spam it here <SEP> And why is a "rise of nation" game on Ethereum, where ever minor thing costs money, and you need two different currencies <SEP> Tokens are to represent money. Where's the money in this? In effectively selling a fictional object? It's fictional lol. You'll never be able to program a fullly comprehensive contract to handle it without a simulator. That would cost too much gas. As Ethereum is public, anyone can just copy the data. Why pay for anything? <SEP> @VinothRajaJ_twitter To finish with what I was saying, you have a BIG perception problem - no one in their right mind EVEN if they 'get' your vision would invest in this - I am a mentor to startups and while I am in the U.S. where people invest and buy the stupidest stuff, this doesn't even feel/seem professional/serious. I'm ALL for innovation but there has to be some level of standard/professionalism here. Saying that you are an very early stage ICO isn't enough of a justification sorry to be direct. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Totally agree with your points

<SEP> Hii <SEP> `Quiark` CyberSecurity Career, no coins were re-routed. Transactions are in limbo but they either go through or not at all <SEP> `Quiark` Zippydoo, replay attack only applies to ETC .. a tx moving ETH can be also used to move ETC <SEP> i saw the code of MultiSigWallet.sol, onlyWallet(msg.sender != address(this)),how i can get contract address's private key? <SEP> anyone know how does it work? <SEP> `Quiark` contract doesn't have private key <SEP> i know ,but how can i pass the modifier onlyWallet? <SEP> `Quiark` that is about address, not private key <SEP> i know ,but the code show you must sign tx with the private key(the contract address's),you can pass the modify,i am confused <SEP> modifier onlyWallet() {         if (msg.sender != address(this))             throw;         _;     } <SEP> MultiSigWallet  ,how does it work? <SEP> https://github.com/ConsenSys/MultiSigWallet <SEP> `Quiark` skykingit, no it applies to txs sent by the smart contract. If they originate from the contract, they don't have to be signed IMHO <SEP> how long eth will keep a pending txn? <SEP> @matrixbot hey my friend, sorry -I had to leave for a bit.  Thanks for the advice.  What did you mean by a "tx"?  I guess what I'm wondering is if I create a wallet on "myetherwallet" (the destination for my ETH), and a separate wallet, which is compatible with ETC, "Geth", I'd try to do this:   1.  Transfer funds from the presale wallet into the "Myetherwallet", and then do the same transaction into the "Geth" wallet.  Would this effectively split my ETC and ETH up? <SEP> `Quiark` Zippydoo, actually I don't know the details. I remember there was an official coin split contract, you should try to google it up <SEP> ok.  Ive read a lot about it, but Im not sure what is the best current way to do it, and I really dont want to screw it up.  It sucks because I dont know how to code at all. <SEP> it decide which net(ETC OR ETH) you connected <SEP> @matrixbot at the end of the day though, if I try sending a portion, (like 1 ether) from my presale wallet to test the waters on various wallets, It is impossible to compromise the rest of my presale funds in the wallet that have not been touched, right? <SEP> or tampered with, correct? <SEP> in other words, its not an all or nothing thing when it comes to touching the presale wallet, right? <SEP> `Quiark` https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4xezwm/what_happens_in_a_replay_attack_in_ethetc_wallets/ <SEP> hey thanks. ill read it, but is my point true or not, in your opinion? <SEP> `Quiark` Zippydoo, if you try like with 0.1 ETH you'll be fine ... but it doesn't prove anything <SEP> ok thanks man <SEP> `Quiark` Zippydoo, what could happen is that say you want to sell 100 ETC so you send it to exchange <SEP> `Quiark` Zippydoo, in that case you could lose 100 ETH <SEP> and vice versa <SEP> buy buy buy!
<SEP> hey i downloaded ther ethereum wallet for osx and have been waiting for the block chain to download, its been downloading for 8 days now and im only at 50%. is there anyway to speed this up? <SEP> @hotdogs4Cats_twitter  You have 3 options:  *wait and be patient *kill the chaindata folder and start from scratch with --fast *use a light client <SEP> im super basic, idk how to even enter --fast, i looked that up once, its beyond me, i guess im stuck waiting, i just dont understand how it can be this slow, my mbps is 50 <SEP> @hotdogs4Cats_twitter the connection isnt the bottleneck your client has to calc everything anybody did in Ethereum during syncing <SEP> ya guess i just wait. <SEP> --fast eliminates that and downloads the state faster  the light client doesnt have the state it can only verify that TXs are in the chain <SEP> now the reason its a major pain, i didnt realize the block chain had to be downloaded before i could see my funds, so i sent a few eth from coinbase to my main wallet address on the ehtereum wall <SEP> dont worry about your money, its fine as long as you have the keyfile backuped. You should defenitly Back up your keyfile. <SEP> ok. and my keyfile back up is the long list of words correct? <SEP> Did I say you should backup your keyfile. Cant stress that enough. There is no recovery <SEP> keyfile* <SEP> yes this is called a seed its basicly your account. everody who has the seed has your money <SEP> no one has that long list of words <SEP> uhhhh potentialy even me <SEP> wait found something <SEP> sorry for allt he basic questions but <SEP> can i download a different wallet client and access the ethereum wallet as long as i have this seed? <SEP> you need the private key for recovering your money in an account, there are different ways to generate the private key. One way is the seed , another way is a keyfile+pw <SEP> as long as you and nobody else has the seed everything is fine <SEP> what about using myethereumwallet.com. a message board post says i can recover a wallet here <SEP> I dont use the service, i dont know if they support your seed. <SEP> hi which software should i use to mine ether that is reliable, easy to use and has no malware <SEP> which hardware do you have? <SEP> **could you help me , how can i open my wallet from browser?

<SEP> hi <SEP> @reddhouse hi Justin....yes...i believe by default it is using geth and in my experience used the same chain data <SEP> Awesome. Thanks Gregg. I was hoping to avoid another 20GB download, but perhaps since I'm doing this for the purpose of splitting ETC/ETH, I'm going to end up with that anyway! <SEP> @rajeshharekala1_twitter hi Rajesh...it's a networked database that lets you do stuff like send money and write distributed apps <SEP> @reddhouse hey Justin...i just did the split...sold all my etc at .0025 :(, but i found it much easier to do with myEtherWallet <SEP> it has a function that lets you send just ETC or just ETH or both <SEP> i found it very confusing to trying to keep both chains myself on the same computer <SEP> Indeed. I was going to follow the Steemit blog instructions and have a different chain open on a different user account on my mac <SEP> Somebody asqued for an affiliate program on Ether mining these are the #1 and #2 rated sites: https://www.genesis-mining.com/a/176888 with 3% discount with code pn78Yk or https://hashflare.io/r/32369B2F where you can invest with 20% discount with this code HF16ETHASH20M <SEP> You are looking for another easy to use and free Ether wallet, check this app https://freewallet.org/id/f2367b23 <SEP> Thanks for the conversation! <SEP> Hey, make sure to check out https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sidco.ethereum.ether if you want to earn some FREE ETHER! <SEP> my coinbase wallet gave us a conversion service, so now i can just buy ether with my checking account.  this is all very daunting for someone with zero coding skills. <SEP> @HALMACDAL_twitter hey Harold....what kind of rate/fee are you getting?  is this $/eth?   i've been using them - not the biggest fan btw - anyway seems to cost me about 1% fee to buy btc and then the exchange rate seems unfavorable...maybe another .5% disadvantage <SEP> how do I get an ether? do I have to pay for this ? <SEP> also is there source for the wallet ? <SEP> @ArEnSc  you can buy from coinbase.com <SEP> @ArEnSc https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases you can get source code and binaries here

Trying to tie a physical commodity to the Blockchain will always be difficult because the thinking around physical commodities is from an old frame of reference. I would submit that Blockchain itself has intrinsic value and need not be tied to a physical commodity to retain value. That said, building a real world solar factory to power a mining farm is a great real-world investment IMHO. <SEP> @fjstitch Those Apple stores.

If you don't know where the Apple store is in your city, go to the shopping center where you can't afford to buy clothes, it will be near there. <SEP> @eldarrdir_twitter The maximum number of coins is not relevant to Ethereum the same way it is to other Blockchain technologies.

Your ethereum wallet is yours and yours only no matter what, so do not freak out, if you have your address and your key then you will be able to access, ethereum does not have a timeline either so no matter how long stays there is yours forever, so just make sure you got your correct address and key and relax. remember do not give your key to anyone. <SEP> @TianSc  how much do you pay for energy? <SEP> I am from South Africa, Electricity is Cheap here so I pay $120 a month on Electricity to Run my House and Machine together. <SEP> how much per KW/h <SEP> if you want to make real returns you have to do the math <SEP> there are many calculators on the net for that <SEP> hello? <SEP> ok, if you know what you are doing hardware-wise, do the math on your expected return and don't forget that ETH might go PoS in the future <SEP> What does it mean that it might go POS? <SEP> @TianSc meaning away from Proof-of-Work won't need CPU/GPU work anymore to validate transactions <SEP> @aliabdalah_twitter  Get a Celeron 7th GEN CPU and 4GB 2400MHz DDR4 RAM... use flash memory with it <SEP> @sh4d0v1 So would that mean that Etherum might not be minable anaymore <SEP> not by GPU work <SEP> or CPU or ASIC etc <SEP> read about Proof-of-Stake <SEP> @sh4d0v1  Thank you, Is there an estimated time when ETH will move to PoS? <SEP> no <SEP> This is what I found related to the PoW to PoS  Good Read  https://www.bitsonline.com/ethereum-difficulty-bomb-delay/ <SEP> @aliabdalah_twitter  you can move to different coin then <SEP> @aliabdalah_twitter  Not Useless you'd still be able to mine but at an exaggerated difficulty - which will feel like you aren't doing anything same as currently trying to mine Bitcoin with a 6 GPU machine  But you can always move to Monero hereafter <SEP> @izverev-aexsoft byzantium fork
<SEP> Hello! <SEP> Has anyone experienced the Etherum wallet account not updating? <SEP> A friend recently transferred ETH to my Ethereum wallet account address (he verified on his end), but I do not see the value updated in my wallet account, despite constant sync with blockchian <SEP> Really baffled <SEP> @intelligentspaz3 @tjade273  Yes, I guess a "layman's definition" of Turing Complete would be something like "a personal computer" rather than a "pocket calculator".    You have enough operations available that you can do pretty much anything.  Another thing worth noting is that the Ethereum virtual machine is only pseudo-Turing complete, because of the gas limits.    On a PC for example, you could do some incredibly complex calculation which takes hours to run, but you couldn't do that on Ethereum, because you would run out of gas.    So you have access to the same level of complexity, but only for a limited amount of time. <SEP> Hey @pinecrest515, You would need to troubleshoot this with your friend using block-chain explorers, etc. If no exchange was involved, the most likely thing is that some mistake was made in the target address.   Just double-check all of the details. <SEP> @angelomilan np! <SEP> Thanks Bob, appreciate the response.  I am pretty sure that the address was correct, as it was a direct copy and paste from my Ethereum wallet address. <SEP> @bobsummerwill I verified via https://www.etherchain.org that the transfer indeed did take place and is recorded on the blockchain....now I am really baffled why it is not showing up on my wallet account <SEP> Maybe http://reddit.com/r/ethereum, @shouse7.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> @DrVikTroll hi <SEP> Is there an official, trusted, android wallet of Ethereum? <SEP> I found compatible ones but how could I trust third party apps? <SEP> @DrVikTroll yeah there is <SEP> @DrVikTroll check your private message.. i sent you info <SEP> thanks <SEP> So this did not help me. Anyone else has info about an OFFICIAL Ethereum wallet? <SEP> @DrVikTroll official android wallet don't exist. <SEP> 5000 szabo = $0.08(8 cents), so smart-contracts is very expensive, if your DApp is non-profit and have hundreds of thousands transactions. Is there a solution which does not require such expense? <SEP> have your users pay for it? <SEP> ethereum has a cost to use, that is not going away <SEP> only way is to shift the cost to end users <SEP> if your non profit cant pay for it <SEP> Yeah, no matter what, you'll have to pay for the transaction <SEP> Either that or have a fund created to support your non-profit <SEP> Like a DAO for your non-profit to fund the transactions <SEP> clear, thanks <SEP> ethereum has a cost to use, that is not going away  but it is possible if there is a transition to Proof of Stake? <SEP> No, Proof of Stake will still have a cost associated to it <SEP> Instead of paying people to donate computational power, you're paying people to keep their Ethereum on the Network <SEP> After POS, they may lower the cost of ETH transactions, but there will still be a cost <SEP> If there was no reason for miners to keep nodes running on the network, then the network falls apart <SEP> note that you can always run your own private ethereum network where there are no tranasction fees <SEP> but then you have to pay for that... <SEP> e.g. servers, storage, network, power, etc <SEP> and you aren't connected to the rest of the world <SEP> People seem to have problems with Ethereum Wallet <SEP> MEW also supports hardware wallets if you want the higher security <SEP> what are you referring to? <SEP> about the "difficulty number" in the block header <SEP> oh in a mined block/

Deleted everything but the keystore folder. Reloaded the entire chain from scratch..But the other wallet address still won't successfully send.  I do briefly get the "this trasaction is likely to fail, etc"  message for a split second when first hitting send, but flashes so quick can't read the entire message. Any more ideas? This is clearly a bug that needs to be looked at.  Thanks. <SEP> @twentyfoursevenether Did you use geth 1.7.2 to refresh your chain? <SEP> Have you all tried https://ethcrash.io?

<SEP> hello <SEP> i want to ask about daily incomes if i have ethereum miner with only one grafic card <SEP> @MeetDhruv Use `Ethereumjs-tx` for your needs. <SEP> @AliceTheHive apologies for the bother... <SEP> does it helps me generate addresses? <SEP> @MeetDhruv No worries, dear.

For multiple addresses, you need to understand the principal that * `Ethereum` is `not Bitcoin`; where you can combine inputs and all funds at an address go into a transaction, with multiple outputs. * In `Ethereum`; all addresses are their own wallets and have their own funds, and when you spend, you only send what you need.  If you need a `workaround`; read this for a try-out @ https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/20983/can-i-create-100-unique-addresses-for-the-same-wallet <SEP> ! <SEP> @KryptoBuddy Somewhere up there in the earlier chats, I've shared how to identify a Contract or Smart Contract. Let me  dig-up if I still have the shots. <SEP>   <SEP> That's it! <SEP> You can query the addresses then... <SEP> @KryptoBuddy You should delete the post... your post contain your `PrivateKey!` <SEP> Make sure you cover/blank it next time! :worried: <SEP> :+1: <SEP> @KryptoBuddy Visit https://etherscan.io/.

<SEP> Hi @AzDragon_twitter . <SEP> @papanzio1_twitter Make sure you downloaded wish from the official GitHub repo. <SEP> In the crypto world there has been a history of exchanges getting hacked or otherwise stolen from.  Now people are slow to trust them, for good reason.  However, if you don't backup your keys or password, a local wallet could be a bad solution as well.  I wouldn't recommend my mother uses a local wallet because in my experience she isn't good at managing her own backups or remembering her password. <SEP> However, I keep the bulk of my funds in my local account because I trust myself to backup my keys and password more than I trust all exchange. <SEP> Also, some exchanges have daily withdraw limits that don't allow me to quickly move money. <SEP> @Jacherb Can you show a screenshot of your problem?  I don't think I understand. <SEP> Sooo what's the likelihood of a hard fork gaining network consensus? <SEP> 51% <SEP> @AzDragon_twitter  What do you think the uphill battle could be? I would have loved to do for Woocommerce but I found Coinbase has a plugin for Ethereum already. So had to look towards Drupal. Any tip Sir?

Why are the developers not "identified" ? <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter go to System Preferences , security and  allow apps downloaded from... <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter Because the app is not downloaded from Apple Store <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter because apple want you to have apps just from apple:) <SEP> @hegrz nut it takes 21 hours? <SEP> @OttoBubenicek_twitter Good one! :) didnt know that method <SEP> no, something is wrong <SEP> maybe fee to low <SEP> There are apps outside the App store that are built by identified developers. <SEP> can you post the address of the wallet <SEP> @OttoBubenicek_twitter Btw, if i do that: go to System Preferences , security and allow apps downloaded from...

<SEP> hey are there any APIs available for checking the ether stored in ENS domains? <SEP> @Dumb_Stir_Fry_twitter If it was a fully synced chain, with correct time stamps, sure. <SEP> I think you could make money selling your download <SEP> My chain is now close to 200GB. I can create a fresh fast chain however in RAM. <SEP> You should do a youtube video and charge for ad space. You would get millions of views teaching this <SEP> Basically do  a fast sync, wait until it pivots to full blocks. <SEP> The problem is only getting worse every day. If you can be the only source on the internet who actually is a helpful person, I think you could sit back and collect the ad revenue <SEP> Sure, but it will not be a perm solution. If someone has a another comm problem, it may break again. <SEP> Are you suggesting an isolated internet connection that doesn't have family jumping in on it watching netfix and such? <SEP> One needs a monitoring process that detects issues with communications and sends a stop signal to Geth to prevent it from making a mess. <SEP> If you could make that, you would be rich. Everybody would buy it <SEP> If only I had extra 48 hours each day. <SEP> Thanks for your instruction. Because everything else I could find is CRAP <SEP> First set up the ntp service. Windows' time servers suck. <SEP> That was probably my first mistake <SEP> The secondary time server Windows uses is too harsh.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> what would be the best option for new wallet in Ipad <SEP> I sent 0.05 ETH to my ETH Wallet but it has not yet been completed, what could have happened? <SEP> Hello All, If i have to install a private network and create a block chain , what are ther equkirements <SEP> The scam "king token" of cryptos has caused the chaos we see today. Based on the fact that any criminal on the planet can create an erc20 token. Thanks @VitalikButerin you need to get your ass out there and do something for the community to make up for your short comings. <SEP> So I'm an idiot and transferred 2 Ether to what I thought was my wallet.  The platform says "MAIN ACCOUNT (ETHERBASE). The tokens never arrived. What do I do?
<SEP> If I create a non-currency blockchain, how do I create incentives for miners?  Or does Ethereum not require mining? <SEP> @gedanner_twitter,  Like most people here I'm new to this, but I believe you need miners to validate the blockchain security model.  And as I understand it, ETH, is the standard currency for contracts regardless of the fact that it's a non currency blockchain. <SEP> Hopefully someone will jump in correct me if I'm wrong(probably :)) <SEP> Right Nick, so without the currency itself to compensate the miners, what do you substitute?  Pay them outright?  "Tax" the parties in the transaction? <SEP> @gedanner_twitter,  Read the docs here (http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/account-types-gas-and-transactions.html)  If you scroll down to the Example transaction cost (http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/contracts-and-transactions/account-types-gas-and-transactions.html#example-transaction-cost)  it clarifies the pricing/cost structure.   Essentially, I think you will need to mine ETH, or buy it outright. <SEP> Thanks for that <SEP> Anyone with a working up-to-date Ethereum client has a moment to help me out? <SEP> I wanted to try there first but it requires I be logged in with github account <SEP> alternatively if you know how to log folder contents (in windows: open cmd, go to directory, type: dir  <SEP> @bobsummerwill I wanted to know mostly out of curiosity. I had read a few issues people had with 0.8.1, so I was going to delay updating if 0.8.2 was coming today.

<SEP> Yep.   Head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/swarm.    New tech papers and updates are coming very soon. <SEP> I thought you can mine ETH with an Asic? Or that it's not profitable at least. <SEP> I don't think you can mine ETH with an ASIC, at least not alone. <SEP> You have to also run the Ethereum VM. <SEP> @spethoscope Ethereum was designed to be ASIC-resistant, by being memory hungry.   You need at least 2GB of memory on your GPU.    I've not seen any stories about Ethereum ASICs yet.   With the pending switch to proof of stake, there would only be a limited time-window in which that would make sense anyway.
<SEP> Anyone know a good Ether wallet which uses GBP instead of USD? For Windows/mobile <SEP> or just to write to the ETH blockchain? <SEP> @Request-Off-Work it depended on your code <SEP> https://github.com/uzyn/eth-notifier-ui <SEP> so basically every single LoC involves some execution power <SEP> and the more complex your code the higher the cost <SEP> @yihyang  how much would you guess an SMS costs using the eth notifier ui? <SEP> currently gas price is 21.5 gwei <SEP> @ierosvin thanks for filling in <SEP> it makes sense to reduce the cost of transactions if the parties trust one another through the messaging and only writing it to the block every so often <SEP> hmm.. <SEP> that's like 1millionth of a ETH <SEP> 1 Gwei = 0.0000000001 Ether 1 Ether = 264.28 USD <SEP> thank you friend
<SEP> Hello <SEP> why is this crypto currency not simple like bitcoin and others. Where i can just have an account with blockchain. But im confuse how can i get a wallet? How does it work? <SEP> What is a good Ethereum wallet? <SEP> What is a good Ethereum wallet? there isn't one <SEP> So why the hell is the wallet not syncing again ????? do you need to follow the DAO fork ?? <SEP> what is the difference if you don't support the DAO Fork ? <SEP> Parity 1.3.8 EIP150 Hard Fork * HotFix * released with new geth.. https://github.com/hofma100/ethcore/releases/tag/1.3.8 <SEP> @NElohor_twitter I find Ethereum Wallet easy to use. You can download it from here: https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases/tag/v0.8.5 <SEP> @beaver25 Could it be that you are currently syncing the blocks that were created during the recent attacks? <SEP> If so, give it some more time, or wait for the second upcoming hard fork <SEP> @dograba i'm looking at using it in a couple of ways. One where i work we use registries nd are experts in delivery of registry solutions, which ethereum seems ideal for, although for us it would probably not be a public blockchain, preferring a private or other implementation. Secondly i have my own ideas being a seasoned programmer/sysadmin/dba etc about distributed applications and i'm just getting my head around how ethereum works vs freenet, but mainly around contracts which i have to do a bit more reading on. I really can see ethereum - being distributed - as a game changer for a lot of things so i have a lot of reading to do and for the first time in years i'm actually excited by tech again. Watch this space as i aim to share my knowledge, but also ask a lot of questions too!! <SEP> can anyone point me to some documentation around managing multiple personal ethereum installs using a mix of OSes? I mainly run macOS, but also have various VirtualBox VMs running different Linuxes and an old Sun X2200 M2 server which was running pfSense so BSD based, and some AWS cloud servers - i'd like to know what files i can copy to the various platforms to maintain my account for mining instead of multiple accounts. <SEP> @moooooooo I'm pretty sure you can copy and paste your keyfiles between nodes, so that they all can use the same account(s) <SEP> Have you skimmed through: https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.io/en/latest/account-management.html <SEP> aaah excellent! i shall read it now. thanks! <SEP> @moooooooo sounds good. And sounds like you have a plan as well. Keep the questions coming. If you do get to a stage where you see yourself developing a POC then we can help you out as well. And you are right it's a disruptive technology and the  applications seem endless. <SEP> @oskarsandstedt i accidentally have two accounts in the macOS Ethereum Wallet, as it timed out and i clicked it again. Is that allowed? or do i just create a contract in my preferred account once i get an Ether ? <SEP> @dograba thanks mate! I need to buy a whiteboard!! <SEP> You can have as many accounts as you want. If you want to delete one of the two you created, just locate the correpsonding keystore file and delete it (after which you can restart the Ethereum Wallet). Just make sure you don't have any ether in it first :) <SEP> :-) thx <SEP> i actually ran the delete command in geth console but it didn't work. All good. How does geth know which account to assign Ether to if i have two accounts? <SEP> How will you get your ether? Through Coinbase or some other exchange? <SEP> i dont know the answer to that. More reading for me? Do i need to register there too? <SEP> In any way, if you have one account and want to send ether to it, you just make sure that its address (example: 0xb2f69ddf70297958e582a0cc98bce43294f1007d) is set as target for that transaction <SEP> Not sure, I used Kraken but I think Coinbase ins integrated in Ethereum Wallet and allows for small exchanges (U.S residents only though) <SEP> ok i;ll have a read. i've run the miner.stop() as my MBP is getting a bit hot and it's 2am here - time for bed <SEP> sure, read up on the account management and you will soon get the basics <SEP> i'm an Australian, living in NZ, but yeah shall read that later this morning. Thx for your help guys n gals and i shall hit the hay now - be on in about 7 hours. <SEP> great morning read :) <SEP> oh one final question - does internet connectivity matter? or is it CPU/GPU ? the reason i ask is that my ISP recently upgraded me to gigabit/500Mb/s from 200/200. later :-) <SEP> It should matter when you connect to other peers and download new blocks. With that speed though, I wouldn't be worried at all <SEP> thx. <SEP> Hi, i'm new to blockchain and looking for a place to talk about that in general. if this isn't the right place to general low level talk for blockchains, please point me to the right direction. i'm trying to find some ircd or other chat platform to talk about it. thanks! <SEP> @- <SEP> @ItchyJunk you can either ask here or connect with me separately on Skype @baljeetdogra007. ....I also host webinars occasionally that may interest you <SEP> @dograba ah ty! i don't have skype but Ill definitely keep that in mind! <SEP> Feel free to chat privately if you have specific questions <SEP> Too new so nothing for now! thanks! <SEP> ?* <SEP> @SmokyDonkey you can disregard that message, syncing should continue anyway <SEP> @oskarsandstedt  Ooh okay, but I have 7 of them in a row & doesn't say anything about  new blocks downloaded? <SEP> I usually have to wait for a while for new blocks to be downloaded, especially if the blocks were created during the attack <SEP> Yes, should be much faster <SEP> But it requires that you start from scratch (i.e. delete the blockchain data that you have synced up to now9 <SEP> Try: 1. geth removedb 2. geth --fast --cache=1024 --jitvm <SEP> Well I'm at 2,416,017 of 2,451,165 I don't think I should delete everything to then restart all over? <SEP> Ok, in that case, you can't run with the --fast flag

<SEP> hi <SEP> Can anyone tell me how to create a new type of digital currency like Ethereum? <SEP> @nita007 http://ethdocs.org <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> please help to food of Ukraine 0x7f535A871920F40C256B1A037f3c7482908f4c87 <SEP> Are there any costs to pay to Ethereum Organization when creating own currency which is based on Ethereum? <SEP> Every transaction that changes the blockchain state has to be paid for. Miners get paid for keeping the blockchain secure. <SEP> how to buy in india <SEP> @phalexo thanks for response. Just to make it clear: if a new currency is created built on ether, on every transaction in this new currency a fee will be paid to Ethereum organization? <SEP> Every transaction that changes the state, but not the organization. It's the miners that get paid for mining your transaction. <SEP> You could become a miner if you like. <SEP> @Gozmanbiz <SEP> what is it that you want <SEP> I need an email address for ethereum. My company is working on blockchain Technology but for me i think Ethereum is the way. The blockchain idea is from me but need to write them officially. So i need the info email.
<SEP> Complete newbie and had a question on the Ethereum Wallet. I am able to launch the wallet and view my balance. I created a password a few months back but when I try to transact, it says the password is invalid. Any idea how to fix this? <SEP> Id like to set up a business to provide  blockchain service to banks in taiwan <SEP> my family are banking <SEP> are in banking <SEP> how do i get started ? <SEP> No, I am able to log in and see my ether balance. I have never changed my password but when I look to transfer ether, I get a 'wrong password' message <SEP> I've tried pyethrecover but that doesn't work since I only used one password the first time and never changed it <SEP> Yes, I know <SEP> I realize it's not the same <SEP> I noted down the password used the very first time and never changed it. In fact, this is the first time I tried to transact since creating the wallet in November 2016 <SEP> oh okay <SEP> If you examine the keystore  folder, you can take a look at the files there to see if  they are damaged. <SEP> What do I need to look for? <SEP> "keystore" folder look for UTC* files. <SEP> Yes,  I have that <SEP> How would I know it's corrupted/damaged? <SEP> Make a backup just in case you'll remember the password. <SEP> cat them to the screen, these are text files. Make backups <SEP> Yes, I have a backup of the json UTC file <SEP> You have it elsewhere?\ <SEP> Yes <SEP> I've saved it as ether-wallet.json <SEP> Then first make a backup of what you have now, and then copy your old backup into the keystore folder. <SEP> I meant, I backed up the UTC file just today <SEP> Hadn't done it before <SEP> Oh. <SEP> You can try 1 more thing but I doubt it would help. <SEP> You can move the UTC file out of the keystore folder and reimport it using the UI from the other location. <SEP> It is unlikely to help if the password is wrong. <SEP> seems i am living in a isle of awesomeness, are you guys beeing ripped of by your banks? <SEP> Will try <SEP> Thanks for the help <SEP> wont say that switzerland or scandinavia have even better wellfare system. <SEP> @bacchu I tnink you changed the password and forgot about the change. If a lot of money is at stake, maybe a hypnotist can help you remember the new password. <SEP> where u from phalexo? <SEP>  @KingScorpio Great welfare system in the "Fatherland" too, all the lazy losers can mooch off the people who work. that is not the problem im germany actually productivity is so high few people in agriculture basically feed thausands. germanies problems arent economic they are structural its about finding jobs etc... <SEP>  @phalexo No it's hardly $50 :smile: <SEP> @bacchu Money well spent for a great lesson. MAKE BACKUPS, REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORDS. <SEP> True that <SEP> Some people came here who lost $150K, $100K in ether.

<SEP> Ethereum wallet dosent shows any balance in my account. <SEP> Is there any issues with ethereum <SEP> Etherscan it shows the transaction pending. How much time it will take for confirmation <SEP> @Tittumjohn2_twitter  that's not what I'm asking acc, I know that there are 2 ways of earning money while using BTC or Ether, mining and investment, I am in the mining section, and I want to know if I can measure I earn from ether, it more or less like a job, you tend to go for a job that has higher pay, my question is just the same thing
<SEP> hello guys <SEP> can i ask questions here if i'm having troubles interacting with a smart contract? :) <SEP> Hi how can i join ethereum and mine coins? <SEP> @saitejanalamala here is a link to an open source iOS Ethereum app that might help you: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5sv0ch/ethers_wallet_for_ios_ethersio/ <SEP> @etartakovsky yes <SEP> @medlahbib you specified using them for rewards, so that would mean token reward upon completion of shared project/milestone, so tokens as time reward perhaps.  That would give the opportunity to reduce cost by reducing pay-scales for new employees- due to this new system implemented.  Interesting thought to entertain at least. <SEP> "Ether is to be treated as "crypto-fuel", a token whose purpose is to pay for computation, and is not intended to be used as or considered a currency..." What's the downside of using Ether as a currency? <SEP> Is there guidance about how to use it to use e.g. Bitcoin as a currency? <SEP> ether inflation could make using it too expensive for some use cases <SEP> regardless of the intent, ether is considered a crypto currency like bitcoin, in fact it has the second largest market cap behind bitcoin <SEP> @chafey What use cases are those? <SEP> micropayments <SEP> bitcoin has this problem right now <SEP> originally you could do a transaction on bitcoin for like .01 USD <SEP> now it is like .25 USD <SEP> so it has become too expensive for small transaction ammounts <SEP> if I want to charge the user .10 USD <SEP> it costs them .35 USD, .25 for the bitcoin transaction cost <SEP> Do you know of a better currency for micropayments? <SEP> You can create your own currency with ethereum <SEP> called tokens or coins <SEP> so they are application or domain specific <SEP> still costs ether to use them... <SEP> so ether inflation is still an issue in general <SEP> i kind of wonder if the ethereum devs will do things to keep ether inflation down <SEP> just for that reason <SEP> perhaps they could reduce the gas cost for transactions somehow?  idk <SEP> My use case is a seller donating part of a transaction to the buyer's causes, to attract their custom. So there will be micropayments, else a mechanism to hold them back until they're big enough. <SEP> Thanks Chris. <SEP> yes that could be an issue then <SEP> I'll look into the advantages of creating my own coin for it. <SEP> Reading the

<SEP> @kayabaNerve Thanks for replying! The smart contracts use events to send info to the higher level interface (I'm planning to use web3.js) which then interacts with the storage. The flow of information only goes one way, but since the contract-storage interaction is also one way (contract alters storage) it'll prob be fine. I'm kinda new to all this, so if I'd done anything wrong some feedback would be appreciated:) <SEP> @ZeframLou How is the contract alter storage? <SEP> I legit had this idea yesterday <SEP> Creator sets the initial one <SEP> People add patch files under a single IPFS index file <SEP> People vote on it <SEP> Eth contracts store a list of hashes as they are voted in <SEP> Reputation controls the system <SEP> I didn't think of funding though <SEP> @kayabaNerve To be perfectly honest with you, I don't really know...As I said, I'm new to this, so this is like my learn-by-doing project...I haven't got the time to read through the IPFS docs yet, so I can't give you anything more that what I just did. Sorry for getting your hopes up, I guess.:( <SEP> @ZeframLou ... Solidity shouldn't be able to alter IPFS <SEP> It's two separate networks <SEP> You'd need an user to upload new files and the hashes (hashes point to a specific file, always; they can't change) <SEP> Same with Swarm IIRC <SEP> And Swarm also can't be modified from Solidity <SEP> @kayabaNerve That's why I'm using the contract event= <SEP> I'm saying it's not trustworthy <SEP> Who verifies it's the correct hash? <SEP> Who says what the new hash is? <SEP> How does the contract verify someone isn't just saying it's the new hash? <SEP> That's a single point  of failure

<SEP> Sup folks, is it possible to store encrypted data on the chain that can only be revealed by a transaction? <SEP> @im_manaspratap_twitter this is a welcome chat, mostly absolute beginners here, some veterans to point them into the right direction also some scammers here, be careful <SEP> @markfarl you can store any data on the chain, as long as only you have the key to decrypt it, it is safe <SEP> But that would require my having a backend running? I think what im asking where only FE webapp communicates with the chain, is impossible <SEP> you also can connect to a full node on another machine <SEP> thanks, I'm still a noob, do begginers share source code here for advice?

So far my recommendation is: remove the DAO contract from your watchlist and redownload the whole chain <SEP> Ok will do, thanks for suggestion. <SEP>  <SEP> @alexvandesande i might have to wait for fix, unable to remove the DAO contract from watchlist. <SEP> ill run another node on different device to purchase more DAO tokens in the meantime. <SEP> We are planning to get a new release with new fixes for monday <SEP> So if youre waiting to that to buy dao tokens, then it wont be a problem as their price will be still the same <SEP> fantastic, thanks for the update. <SEP> Hello.

I have our study group this evening, so I thought I should give some 15 min super intro to go through terminologies <SEP> Quick question about Wallet and private net. Can I connect my wallet to private net or I can only connect my wallet to mainnet/testnet? <SEP> You can connect to any private net. <SEP> Youll need to control your node using the command line <SEP> I started geth with same port number (30303) <SEP> Youll need to open the correct ipc path: ``` geth --fast --cache 512 --ipcpath ~/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc console ``` so that the wallet sees you <SEP> cool working. <SEP> I can see 8400Ether on my wallet. Feeling rich <SEP> did you add the parameters for a private net? <SEP> Just tell me the truth please... Geth is named after Mass Effect, right xD?!
<SEP> hey guys any news on ethereum? <SEP> When does the Rocket start going off!!!!! <SEP> Help Anyone? <SEP> I am here <SEP> well which platform are you using? <SEP> poloniex? <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> no, I just sent them from my mist wallet to Changelly, but 2 of the numbers were reversed, I tried to copy and paste but my Mist wallet wouldn't let me paste the address <SEP> I used the mist wallet because it was downloaded directly from the ethereum.org page and Felt that it would be the most secure. <SEP> Any advice on where to contact? <SEP> Hi. Can I get an answer to your question on transactions REP? <SEP> Hi, My issue ended up being a matter where Changelly received my money and posted it to an older order where the wallet address was identical other than 2 digits, so the transaction went through but on the order before. <SEP> Hey everyone! Would really appreciate some help. My chain data became corrupt with my Ethereum Wallet and I was forced to wipe the application and the data from my Mac. I have multiple copies of the chain data and keystore folders before the corruption took place. However, when I imported the keystore folder into a fresh install of Ethereum Wallet on another Mac, it was showing $0 Balance in my Wallet. <SEP> are your blocks up to date? <SEP> @stevenzeisler You have to sync up to the blockchain before you see your balance. 1.5 days. <SEP> @phalexo - thanks for the information! ok sounds good...I just wanted to make sure I was doing the process the right way by importing the UTC file <SEP> I am not 100% sure, but I would imagine since how else would It know what transactions have taken place to account for your balance. just my thought someone please correct me if I am incorrect in my assumption <SEP> @stevenzeisler Since you have a partial blockchain backup it should be a shorter process.

Why isn't there time better spent by trying more nonce values? I know that miners get to claim used gas, but from looking at recent blocks, the value of those seem much smaller than the 5 eth gained from mining successfully. Hoping someone can point me towards an answer <SEP> `mistaken113` Nicolo: article is a little spammy but I get your point. <SEP> @matrixbot yeah I get you, it's mainly just showing the potential profit and promoting my code to be honest haha <SEP> `mistaken113` Thats rather obvious <SEP> anyone managed to sync there wallet today? <SEP> what will happen to my transactions that are still pending ? <SEP> if they are in ethereum.org wallet  your knackered <SEP> `mistaken113` How knackered <SEP> `mistaken113` I'm not impacted, just trying to understand the implications of what is happening today <SEP> What is happening with GWEI? 50 GWEI are sometimes being process and other times getting lost?

Is that accurate? <SEP> no one answers the questions no point in posting <SEP> @matrixbot i would love to know whats going on as well <SEP> will they roll back all the transaction of today ? <SEP> ? <SEP> alot of users got fucked <SEP> Its just madness.  I know that yestardays ICO obviously borked the network with all those transactions.    I don't think there is any rolling back capabilities. <SEP> alot of burned coins <SEP> theres about 20k users reporting to coin base there coins got burned <SEP> yeah poloniex users as well <SEP> coinbase and all other will literally have to pay <SEP> @CyberCareers_us_twitter do you have a link for that? <SEP> so because of the nature of the dynamic block size ethereum uses it crashed it self because the blocks were too large to process? <SEP> @djtwerkz_twitter let me find it <SEP> @djtwerkz_twitter my friend told me this so i will say its hearsay <SEP> ah <SEP> no one is reporting about the looming burn that just happened "inside info" <SEP> We too are just sorta going by user reports, customer support cases etc <SEP> @djtwerkz_twitter its pretty fucking crazy that this can happen to any coin out there <SEP> i got $500 in ether burned today <SEP> im dying <SEP> ill survive but it hurts <SEP> yeah so it looks like there might be some merit to it https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/the-ethereum-network-is-ddos-ing-itself <SEP> so if bancor was DDossing then yestardays ICO was at least double the traffic soooo...... <SEP> they are not going to reverse todays tx's

You should know if they call it. <SEP> OR you should expect it, and it will fail. That's the smart contract version. You allow a contract to spend X. They try it. It knows if it succeeds or fails. <SEP> TBH, that's why that call exists. Smart Contracts. <SEP> how about getting all the "input" data to contract and scan it for my address? <SEP> But you can also track the event history of the contract <SEP> if i try i, then i need to spend gas to check weather it works or not.. <SEP> But people won't randomly allow it lol. <SEP> No <SEP> Use call instead of creating a TX <SEP> Event history.

I exited the MIST wallet several times now to attempt to sync the Ethereum node.  Every time I try to Sync it, it goes extremely slow, but most of the time it just eventually Freezes...which I then exit out of syncing the node and try restart the MIST wallet again.  Sometimes when I exit the Ethereum node while it is trying to sync upon MIST wallet start up, it goes straight to my MIST wallet....this is where I notice NO NEW ETHER.... hopefully it shows up somwtime.....or am I going to have to cross my fingers and hope the ethereum nodes someday successfully SYNC? <SEP> @justinkelii it says no ether because you are not synced yet. Once you are synced they may show up. One thing that helps sometimes is to make sure your computer's clock is set properly. Make sure it is syncing with time.nist.gov <SEP> Also, you could try the fast sync process I described above <SEP> There are more answers  <SEP> @tjade273 Thank You so much.  I will be patient.  Also,  at about what time/day on this help blog did you explain how to do a Fast Sync Process,  Thank you so much for your help so far <SEP> Just now, <SEP> https://gitter.im/ethereum/welcome?at=5737677c1794136a7d08ab83 <SEP> helloK I need credit card support Ether any one can help me <SEP> pls any one help me to get credit card Ether <SEP> Ya selfish with certain info <SEP> Hello all.  Created a wallet a few months ago and bought some ETH.  I'm positive that I have the right passphrase, but it's not being recognized now.  Any known issues along these lines? <SEP> Oops.

<SEP> everybody help me? I have ICN (ICONOMI) token balance in my Yobit ethereum wallet, how to claim this? thank you <SEP> @zarkasi92 This only iconomi will be able to tell you, as this is their very own token. <SEP> @nikita-fuchs I tell Yobit but  they do not understand <SEP> I want to think of the Syndicated Loan process <SEP> You have to think it the other way round: the banks would move something into the blockchain. And there, they could interact with contracts and change things, for example, the owner of a loan, by selling it for a price and whatever. Just considder: the more data you want to put on the network, the more it will cost you <SEP> Thanks @nikita-fuchs  more it will cost, you mean by via of gas, transaction fee on ether ? <SEP> @ram2580 yes. The rule of thumb is always: how much am i changing the state of the ethereum virtual machine? The more changes, the more costs. Accordingly, reading (not changing anything) is always free.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> Got a fast question: ethereum blockchain is stored locally as a Json file, right? <SEP> Yes right <SEP> Is there somewhere I can get it from without running Geth? <SEP> Hello, Are there any issues with block 2283415 / 2283416. Geth is stuck at this block. I have tried version 1.5.9 and 1.6. <SEP> If read about a DOS attack on this block with a new Get released but that was at september last year <SEP> hello guys :) <SEP> Tests are failing with a clean install of truffle (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) is this a known issue? <SEP> Also some advice would be helpful. I only using Truffle to make web3.js calls and transactions easier. Is it really a pain to do these using just web3.js and do people think the added overhead of Truffle is worthwhile? <SEP> FYI my current environment: Truffle v3.1.2, macOS (latest), EthereumJS TestRPC <SEP> In addition I do a full scan because when I try a fast scan I don't see my bought Ethereum in my Wallet when it is fully synced.  Is it correct dat a fast scan don't get you're transactions (mine is from a last friday).  Or is it because I need to have the Ethereum Wallet software open while I'm syncing through geth? I can't let the Ethereum Wallet sync by itself trough geth because Windows is closing geth at the background after a minute (tested on 2 computers). So I run geth standalone in my command prompt while having the Ethereum Wallet software open. <SEP> I'm interested to Ethereum but my English is not so WELL :worried: <SEP> anyone have links on how to set up ethereum test network ? <SEP> Someone Speak Italian in this Chat ? <SEP> If I have two seperate private networks, how do I call contracts in one network from the other?

It seems to be focussed purely on storing files and data, not on executable content. <SEP> RE:  File storage.    Yes.   Give me a second ... <SEP> i suspect it will be more client side web apps on maidsafe but right now they getting the storage and the data working.   who knows what the cost of storing will be... the talk of having a dropbox that pays for itself by sharing some of your hard disk is cool.... but that... they still working on <SEP> It's called Swarm (see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOC45AgZG5Q) and has been in hibernation for the past few months but is under active development again now.    Lots of people are also using IPFS (https://ipfs.io) which fits with Ethereum very nicely, but unlike Swarm is actually already at a Beta stage and is live in the world.    IPFS is more like Bittorrent, though, in that it is a mechanism for getting files spread around the world, but without an incentive mechanism.   That means it will be fine for pirate videos, but maybe not so great for saving your family photos on.    Juan Benet, the lead for IPFS, is a real friend of the Ethereum community.   He spoke at that same DEVCON1 conference too.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewpIi1y_KDc <SEP> Viktor Tron just wrote this about Swarm vs IPFS: https://gist.github.com/zelig/954937b915768b8a8d2c

Of course, there are challenge on assigning the pool of protein folding required to be solved. This is a good biological problem with many applications. (sometimes, medicine). There pre-exists a P2P application doing just that ( except that it use GUI for a person to do the work.). In Proof of Work version of Protein folding, you compute the thermodynamics... it should not be too hard to verify either...

<SEP> wow github chat :D <SEP> Earlier I downloaded the E Wallet, and successfully obtained/copied my public address.  This is where the extracted files went C:\Users\*****\Downloads\Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-5-2.zip\Ethereum-Wallet-win64-0-5-2.    I can't find the E Wallet on my pc.  The README note states it should be at Win: C:\users\app data\roaming\Ethereum.     There are no folders named \app data\roaming\ on my pc. Suggestions needed. <SEP> The node had successfully downloaded and the blockchain successfully synced and processed.  I was able to create a password for the E Wallet. Closed the E Wallet screen.  Can't find where in my pc's directory the Ethereum Wallet is located. Tried to extract the zipped files again and message states the files are already existant on the pc.  I did not overwrite them, canceled the (2nd) extraction attempt.

<SEP> Hello <SEP> Any one know how to connect ETH wallet to Exchange Platform <SEP> ETH rpc <SEP> I cound't find more information on website <SEP> Any one know how to connect ETH wallet to Exchange Platform via api <SEP> @ADisgustingPerson by thinking of the actual money "distribution" the "real coins and bills", you have to believe strong in the idea that no bank-run will ever happen again. Meanwhile you have to trust into your government to regulate "everything right" by means of total equality of interests in any kind. <SEP> i think this abstract blind-trusting into above and other mentionable interest-groups as authorities could become dangerous <SEP> i cannot believe in the formula "as the market wants war, we will have" <SEP> as far as it is concerned that war is not to favourize apart from them who earn money with  rigging war items or services and so on <SEP> depends which side you prefer, and for sure your question can be answered in a different way <SEP> @cryptobella_twitter shapeshift.io could help you, i guess there is a guide <SEP> Its pretty awesome... Whether you are looking for some serious answers from professionals or even something silly.

<SEP> Good question! <SEP> What is the significance of Nov 1 date? <SEP> Whenever ETH moves to PoS current mining techniques will no long work. <SEP> But you can just go mine any other altcoin like Sia, zcash, Doge, etc, etc. <SEP> Is mining other coins possible with radeon rx xxx? <SEP> Ahh good point. I did read about that, but didn't realize there was a date set. <SEP> There is no date yet. <SEP> Okay :+1: <SEP> Is it an EIP? <SEP> Officially? <SEP> is there an official announcement about this PoS release date? <SEP> keep in mind that everyone who is now mining Eth will be jumping to other coins as well. <SEP> I'm willing to bet a lot of folks will capitulate and sell their gear at that point. <SEP> I hope so :smile: <SEP> Cheap GPUs for all lol <SEP> @Eleventy5_twitter do you know that you can mine other coins with the radeon rx series? Other than only ETH? <SEP> From what I understand, and feel free to correct me if I am wrong, PoS comes with Metropolis which is slated for August release <SEP> Yes Jack, you can! <SEP> Oke thanks ! <SEP> @vardthomas i have went to the etherscan.io/ but i go to the top right to key in the transaction number <SEP> but nothing come out <SEP> i put in my wallet number also nothing come out <SEP> The search string you entered was:  oxf26ba936c1BFfd35134e49b727fbB551C8B8146D Sorry! This is an invalid search string.  Back Home <SEP> yeah ok, but my question is either if the "handling"/"acceptance" for people who us them will be different <SEP> correct, my understanding is everyone that stakes will get a percentage of the reward. your percentage based on the value of your stake.  I am very new to this though and may be over simplifying it
<SEP> https://www.coinspeaker.com/2017/09/04/peoples-bank-china-declares-icos-illegal/ Thoughts? <SEP> I think it's going to cause a lot of panic, but the market will likely recover. <SEP> I think so too, this is only fresh news aswell so I anticipate it dropping even further over this week <SEP> speculations on price drop? <SEP> A lot of support for ICOs came from China. It can be either really bad for new ICOs outside of China, or maybe good because the ICOs outside of China will have less competition from ICOs on the mainland. <SEP> I think I'll likely make my first investment into Eth when the price stops dropping, when it's as low as it's likely to get. <SEP> Does this law now affect lets say for example a switzerland ICO that allowed Chinese citizens to invesT? <SEP> I doubt it will affect the switz ICO aside from the initial panic, and loss of chinese clientelle. China is unlikely to be able to enforce anything outside of China. <SEP> So it's highly unlikely that the Swiss ICO will have to pay back to Chinese citizens. <SEP> fair <SEP> @Zero-Bits The Chinese government can block all the outside internet access to sites that run ICOs. It is not about the past but the future. <SEP> Crypto likely has a future in China. However, for the near future at least, the Chinese market is likely as dead as it can get. <SEP> Does anyone know if the mainland Chinese government  have control over Hong Kong internet access? <SEP> They blocked Facebook, but you sure have a bunch of Chinese that use VPN servers and access facebook. The same will happen with ICO's.   American's are blocked but we still get on ICO's through VPN's. Just like the Cayman islands are the "companies" address... the same will happen. I see a bunch of ICO launches with companies designated in the Cayman islands and other such countries that have loose regulations and welcome the income they can make from it.

No thanks... <SEP> Are there other wallet apps that aren't a hopeless mess of bugs and poor coding? <SEP> Forgive my assumptions, but this kind of UX is really weird from an official wallet. It's what ethereum.org directed me to use. Not really the best first experience for newbies. <SEP> @maxcamirand https://parity.io/ <SEP> @jdsantiagojr Thx <SEP> `aidalgol` I've heard this before.  Does that run locally, or is it a cloud wallet service? <SEP> @qasimdar7_twitter did you buy a token or ethereum? <SEP> okay yet again it stops downloading and now back to 100,000 blocks when it was at 32,000. your software is bad and you should feel bad. ive been at this for 2 and half months. a waste of time. why dont you guys just use some of that money you made and fix this. or at least offer some boot  straps that are more current . whatever im going to ltc. bunch of bullfuck. fix your shit.

I have good android developer team <SEP> guys, something must be wrong with my win10 machine or eth wallet. i have the latest version of the wallet, by the way. is it normal to take a few days to process 20k+ blocks? last night  it advanced about 10% only, so now it's 21%. <SEP> i might have found the problem: in my setup,  i have moved Ethereum and "Ethereum Wallet" to other disk and created shortcuts in C:\Users\unername\AppData\Roaming. but every time a new version of the wallet is installed, it  seems to overwrite these shortcuts with folders. so i'm guessing, it does the block processing again. <SEP> @wegoins I can help you, as I tried to restore mine recently.

<SEP> Hakkuna Matata <SEP> Hakuna Matata! <SEP> What's up, @Nozzy247? <SEP> @burrocampeador seemed to me in the beginning similar and after a  while it worked as an alternative there is https://parity.io - the question of seriousity could be given by view at running nodes which could be done at ethernodes.org <SEP> as you browse further you will find more than 2 other testnets, even with clients in it, to answer your question, as seriousity has to to with engineering i would say it is one of the most decentralized software project i have ever heard of, still being beta, but smart enough to handle smart-contracts <SEP> to solve the issue it could be helpful about the error logs- as you like to post them here we might find a solution <SEP> Quick question: The solidity compiler in the current Ethereum Wallet is version 0.4.11? Correct?? <SEP> Mine is 0.4.13 <SEP> How can you find the version? <SEP> Not sure what the solidity compiler is called but I just changed the version number on my .sol files until it complained <SEP> I think we all get latest versionm and that is 0.4.13 ATM <SEP> I've just been writing in 0.4.11 for the pragma line. I ask because Etherscan wants to know the compiler when I verify my source. It was throwing up errors if I used the wrong version number in the pragma line <SEP> Not too sure but isnt your line ^0.4.11 <SEP> ^ means anything above it in the 0.4 line <SEP> no idea lol. I'm new to Solidity. I'm used to shebang lines <SEP> http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/layout-of-source-files.html#version-pragma <SEP> So in theory 0.4.9 or 0.4.13 shouldnt cause an error because there are no breaking changes there <SEP> @gusgorman402  there is also a solidity channel, did you saw https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity <SEP> https://newstoday24.online/ethereum-a-critical-vulnerability-found-in-the-myetherwallet <SEP> @edr_coin_twitter ZzZzZzZzZz, no job, frustrated? sorry for you but posting this certain link is no solution nor to you
<SEP> Srsly? <SEP> X4more, if you sent tokens to an address that doesnt understand them, I think they are gone <SEP> Can someone explain to me why tokens are needed for a blockchain company? <SEP> they aren't <SEP> oh I see <SEP> they have uses in certain scenarios <SEP> so whats the point? to raise capital? <SEP> and they are all the rage <SEP> No, they are a cryptographic abstraction of something real <SEP> and if not, does that mean that companys blockchain edit is running on the main net for free? <SEP> its not possible to run on the main net for free <SEP> So I take Eth code, edit it, run my company on it and the ETH network will be hosting it? <SEP> as long as you pay the txn costs <SEP> ah yes of course. <SEP> so the business model would need to make customers pay this <SEP> forking the entire network is a different animal <SEP> well, if its a business it needs to make money <SEP> yes I've read about forks and 2x segwit happening for BTC.. <SEP> totally different thing <SEP> Those forks are all fighting for the same turf <SEP> I am still unsure if I should leave my money on the exchange or my private wallet to receive BTC gold. <SEP> Buy a bunch of usb keys <SEP> put your keys on them <SEP> put them in your safety deposit box at your bank <SEP> I have a nano ledger. <SEP> put that in your box <SEP> But will I receive BTC gold if it's on there? <SEP> i dont know enough about btc gold to answer <SEP> Back to ETH... <SEP> im not tracking any of this btc nonsense <SEP> You know about the Health companies opening? <SEP> storing EHR on the blockchain <SEP> yep <SEP> know all about them <SEP> There business model would be to go to hospitals and integrate with EHR Systems to store patient information. <SEP> they have different approaches <SEP> im working on my own <SEP> So the hospital would pay them and the company such as Paitentory with use some of that money to put the info on the blockchain? <SEP> patientory gives me an ill feeling <SEP> I feel a little embarrassed i've been trading and learning about Blockchain for a while and still dont know this stuff. <SEP> You are working on your own? <SEP> storing medical data is probably the most complex topic <SEP> yeah <SEP> I am a network/system admin and I have around 4 years of experience in the medical field.

That is if you want an answer :smile: <SEP> how could my transaction not have been mined it was over 24 hours ago and thousands of other transactions have gone out and sent from coinexchange.io since and from there sending address there is not 1 out bound with my amount on it .....  how could ones send after go but not mine . ? how do i track it down ? <SEP> @metabol  I sent it 0.25 ether does not show up there <SEP> bitstamp <SEP> @DigiTALCoinz_twitter maybe your tx ran out of gas. During network congestion miners increase gas limit and ignore low gas txs <SEP> Its perfectly normal if a tx fails due to low gass fee...on the otherhand you might want to contact coinexchange there should provide support for their cudtomers <SEP> Same goes for @sukrutkrdg_twitter <SEP> @metabol  I sent a high quantity ether go faster? <SEP> Yup <SEP> @metabol if the gas ran out or there was a transaction at allwouldnt they be able to provide the information about it? they wont tell me anything but an auto generated email. if the gas rate was low how come  the other transactions they sent went through ?  2017-12-04 19:54:25 ETH 1.39273122 0.01000000 0xb0ca5210a669dc61A1Fa38B74EBa83173794F727  0xc6ec993b07abb8f7ba6d7153e6d8fd7c180c51fbf45ca49613c181d0cf681462 <SEP> they should be able to go to the sending wallet and find where it shows the output but there isnt one i checked for hours each one <SEP> Then @DigiTALCoinz_twitter you must insist on tecnical support from them.No coinbase staff here that i know of. :worried: <SEP> We can only help eth specific problems...exchanges are responsible for their customer transactions as they control their own eth infrastructure <SEP> its coinexchange.io that is giving me problems where i sent it from <SEP> wouldnt the transaction be on the blockchain or show pending or some trail if they sent it out? <SEP> Sure it should <SEP> Or run out of gas an return your funds <SEP> Go after them buddy <SEP> exactly and they dont respond except for a auto gen email . so frustratin ! <SEP> wont use them again but i may not be able to get my funds out of there. coinexchange.io is horrible i have so many problems with them now this is the capper <SEP> yea i just bombarded them with emails and support tickets of all kinds that should get there attention !!!! i bet i get it now <SEP> :+1:  :smile: <SEP> Fuck cats <SEP> when they will solve this problem <SEP> i have been waiting for 20 hours now <SEP> WTF

<SEP> hi <SEP> @sjaith what do u mean ? <SEP> my wallet no longer works <SEP> Eth is Geth <SEP> As long as u have the address and the password, u can thank God its fine <SEP> Ethereum does not mean all the poeple who buy it have to be a Geek.
<SEP> ok ... wrong ... contracts cannot listen to events <SEP> sorry <SEP> why this in ECR20: <SEP> function withdraw(address from, address to, uint tokens) public returns (bool success); <SEP> why address to ? <SEP> I can get it by msg.sender no ? <SEP> I'm not sure but maybe if you're using a delegatecall <SEP> if contract A is calling contract B using delegatecall, then msg.sender will be A <SEP>  Incorrect. With a dlegatecall, A will pass on whatever msg.sender it was given by its caller. <SEP> so ... msg.sender is always set ? <SEP> I mean to the caller address <SEP> if in a function of a contract I call 2 methods of another contract ... are they atomic ? <SEP> like  allowance+transferFrom ... <SEP> I mean how could I be sure that the value returned by allowace is still valid when I call transferFrom ? <SEP> holy s**t !!!!! @kayabaNerve ECR20::transferFrom can be called by anyone !!!!! <SEP> my workflow is incorrect
<SEP> hi <SEP> please how can i join and make payments for this particular ico <SEP> what particular ico? I am not understanding. I didn't think ETH is an ico anymore <SEP> wow <SEP> i didnt know <SEP> please can u help nme explain better <SEP> me* <SEP> I think if you want ETH you can buy it. Or you can mine it. Or a new way would be to learn how to operate in the Plasma network. All of these choices are very expensive right now. <SEP> The smartest move would be to buy it when you believe the price has dropped to something you can afford to pay or afford to risk and lose <SEP> thanks <SEP> that was very helpfull <SEP> have you heard of etherumcashpro.com <SEP> no. I have no stake in any crypto currency. I am not buying, either <SEP> i jst heard of it and dnt know much , so i thought you had an idea

Please what would you say is the essential difference between ETH and STRATIS. I understand that the latter works with C#.

Thanks. <SEP> hi i need to know some thing. like i have a eth wallet and id how i mine and payout on there <SEP> and which is the best site for mining

Just not official. <SEP> And Mist is an expansion on ethereum-wallet @kayabaNerve <SEP> I said that <SEP> We are on the same side. <SEP> hehe <SEP> No. We're not <SEP> Ethereum Wallet is what the site hosts.

<SEP> Hi <SEP> i have created my token with rinkeby test , how can i extended and make it real <SEP> @MoezFred2_twitter It's `real-only` in your test-net and no `real effect` on the live main-net! :information_source: <SEP> @AliceTheHive Hope you are keeping well. as guided by you I have imported addresses to metamask. Now  the issue is with sending eth automatically. Right now i have to do it manually . Can you please help me in here <SEP> @mystugg what kind of money do you wanna invest? <SEP> @MeetDhruv https://www.cryptocompare.com/wallets/guides/how-to-use-metamask/ :wink: <SEP> @AliceTheHive Is it possible that I can send ERC20 token on multiple address without signing?  What I want to do is somehow automatize the Send Ether & Tokens procedure from MyEtherWallet. Any kind of help/guidance is really appreciated.  Thank you! <SEP> This airdropper will fail if any of the addresses are contracts that throw. <SEP> :( <SEP> what will be the better way @phalexo <SEP> Write your own and decide what you want to do. Maybe test the addresses and skip contracts. <SEP> actually as per the guidance from @AliceTheHive i have created multiple wallets in myetherwallet and import it to metamask, however if i want to send it to multiple address how can i send by automatic signing rather than manually <SEP> You can't. <SEP> Have to sign at least once, per transaction. <SEP> In any case, the airdrop is limited to maybe 200-300 addresses, then you run into the block gas limit. <SEP> Have to split up the work across multiple blocks. <SEP> You can make your credentials available to a program and have it sign for you if that works. <SEP> @MeetDhruv https://github.com/omisego/airdrop/blob/master/contracts/Airdropper.sol :smile:  It's an `AirDopper` build. Give it a tweak/try. You need to sign-off tx. <SEP> @MeetDhruv @phalexo provides an important pointer. <SEP> @MeetDhruv To resolve/mitigate failing, you need to `enter` the quantity in the same format as the addresses, as in ex  ``` FooInstance.Foofunction.sendTransaction(var1,var2,varx,{from: web3.eth.accounts

<SEP> any recommendations  where to start? trying to buy a small amount <SEP> how to buy ether you mean? <SEP> coinbase.com <SEP> of course its down right now due to AWS issues <SEP> so maybe check back later <SEP> ok thank. have that account. but they also provide with the wallet? i downloaded Ethereum-Wallet-linux32-0-8-9.deb this wallet, can i transfer from coinbase to this wallet? kraken is taking forever to process <SEP> yes you can <SEP> just do a send and put in the address of your wallet <SEP> thanks. and should we be concerned how US is basically demanding user data from coinbase?

<SEP> I send some eth to my accout in mist wallet,but my mist wallet can't sync ethereum network cause I'm in china,and there is few peer.now I want to wirhdraw eth in the account.Is there any one know how to do ? <SEP> @fjh1997 Without syncing you cannot do any transactions. All the balances are stored in the blockchain, your wallet  cannot know how much ether you have without syncing. <SEP> @phalexo I understand,but what if I found a light client for ethereum?there is no need to sync all blocks just like i use electrum to send bitcoin. <SEP> I don't use other wallets, so I cannot recommend any. Maybe others can suggest something. <SEP> @phalexo fine <SEP> Of course, your wallet software will complain that you don't have the balance
<SEP> I sent wrong wallet ETH, This wallet 0x0149621bba832cd8b55e71392a0b5b59f6067d0d and this TX HASH you can check this  0x6d5d4e99b86299f7477fa6b9e43c19eccd4955ee048a57f4ceb536481b0e31e4 I want you to help me regain the ETH that I sent the wrong  Please help me <SEP> @toiselatoi  where did the 0x014... address come from? <SEP> 0x014 to https://private.atlanticgam.es/#/login but i send mail support with us and say At the moment the company has not received your funds

Please help! <SEP> Hello... I want to try to buy some contract tokens - just to try it out - but I have no idea where or when or how. I find a lot of pages that talk about this or that token in superlatives, but no sites  where to exchange <SEP> download the wallet, and then click buy tokens <SEP> Hm. I have just myetherwallet <SEP> So maybe I should just download mist? <SEP> open it <SEP> run the application <SEP> click your wallet, and then click buy ethereum <SEP> no, I don't mean ethereum, I already have some, I meant some of the other tokens <SEP> I see "Token Balances" and all zeroes. I want to try to buy some, just to try how it works <SEP> ! <SEP> can I buy any of those? <SEP> ha, I found some sketchy exchange that sells one of those weird tokens <SEP> that seems exactly like what I want <SEP> I will be the king of "digix dao" baby <SEP> whatever that is <SEP> oh yeah, everything is working as expected  ! <SEP> hail javascript <SEP> Hm. I finally sent some eth to bittrex (more than 0.1 they want)... and I still see no ethers on there even with loads of confirmations now. Guess it's a black hole. <SEP> ok time for another experiment! <SEP> It takes some time, contact bittrex if it don't appears. <SEP> :+1: thanks <SEP> Ha, I got it now <SEP> Guess I panicked too soon <SEP> new here. just installed wallet and want to perform some transactions for learning.  how do I get ether on  TEST-NET? <SEP> or is there a good getting started guide?
<SEP> Hi there! <SEP> I tried to download the Ethereum Wallet (Mist?) for Mac OS X last night. I transferred some Bitcoin to Ethereum as they suggested and then Mist started downloading the entire blockchain. Had no idea it would take this long and have no idea where my Ether is.. Can someone help me? <SEP> @Ldweisser : The initial sync can take days or even not be possible depending on your hardware, if you need quick access to your funds you could try opening an online wallet with your Mist credentials, another alternative is to use a light client like parity (although right now you might be understandably reticent due to their exploit) if you have your txHash you can also check a block explorer like etherscan for peace of mind. <SEP> Thanks @KenoLeon , I was just looking at etherscan now.. It was only .24 ether anyway so not a big deal.. <SEP> Found it! Any recommends for an online wallet? <SEP> I like Blockchain.info, but not sure if you can import from mist, myetherwallet is popular, just make sure you go to the right site, there's a few scam impostor ones. <SEP> Yeah I'm using blockchain.info on my phone but was not able to import the Mist wallet yet <SEP> @Ldweisser Yeah, not sure if the web version has that functionality, you could try that, else you could try myetherwallet.
<SEP> hi, how can i create an etherium wallet? <SEP> easy at myetherwallet site <SEP> @koetsuji try https://nuclux.io the wallet is really easy to use and does not require syncinh the blockchain
<SEP> HI EVERYONE <SEP> good evening <SEP> can anyone tell me about what is connection between ethereum and ethtrade.org. <SEP> rob can u tell me?????? <SEP> ethtrade.org is using the logo of others without authorization, they used the name of Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum Foundation) without autorization too. They seems like to be a scam called Ponzi Scheme https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme <SEP> @ATHARV2010 All indicators is that they are a scam. <SEP> https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/728811334939348992 <SEP> o my god it is very dangerous. <SEP> Here is some discussion on reddit about it https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4myjk8/scam_warning_httpsethtradeorg/ <SEP> https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4ss9uj/ethtradeorg_are_scammers_with_no_shame/ <SEP> Unfortunely a lot of people believe in ethtrade since they are paying (for now) but we've seen lot's of schemes that in the start worked and ended by stealing all users funds <SEP> There is no way to trust on ethtrade since they used to lie in the past (about Vitalik) and still lie putting that logos on the bottom (like if they were parteners) <SEP> Stay away from anything promising high earning upon deposits in their "closed" "centralized" "obscure" account.
<SEP> hey i downloaded ther ethereum wallet for osx and have been waiting for the block chain to download, its been downloading for 8 days now and im only at 50%. is there anyway to speed this up? <SEP> @hotdogs4Cats_twitter  You have 3 options:  *wait and be patient *kill the chaindata folder and start from scratch with --fast *use a light client <SEP> im super basic, idk how to even enter --fast, i looked that up once, its beyond me, i guess im stuck waiting, i just dont understand how it can be this slow, my mbps is 50 <SEP> @hotdogs4Cats_twitter the connection isnt the bottleneck your client has to calc everything anybody did in Ethereum during syncing <SEP> ya guess i just wait. <SEP> --fast eliminates that and downloads the state faster  the light client doesnt have the state it can only verify that TXs are in the chain <SEP> now the reason its a major pain, i didnt realize the block chain had to be downloaded before i could see my funds, so i sent a few eth from coinbase to my main wallet address on the ehtereum wall <SEP> dont worry about your money, its fine as long as you have the keyfile backuped. You should defenitly Back up your keyfile. <SEP> ok. and my keyfile back up is the long list of words correct? <SEP> Did I say you should backup your keyfile. Cant stress that enough. There is no recovery <SEP> keyfile* <SEP> yes this is called a seed its basicly your account. everody who has the seed has your money <SEP> no one has that long list of words <SEP> uhhhh potentialy even me <SEP> wait found something <SEP> sorry for allt he basic questions but <SEP> can i download a different wallet client and access the ethereum wallet as long as i have this seed? <SEP> you need the private key for recovering your money in an account, there are different ways to generate the private key. One way is the seed , another way is a keyfile+pw <SEP> as long as you and nobody else has the seed everything is fine <SEP> what about using myethereumwallet.com. a message board post says i can recover a wallet here <SEP> I dont use the service, i dont know if they support your seed. <SEP> hi which software should i use to mine ether that is reliable, easy to use and has no malware <SEP> which hardware do you have? <SEP> **could you help me , how can i open my wallet from browser?

<SEP> how does myetherwallet work without the syncing process? <SEP> Hey guys. I will not be trading my ETH (at least not in the beginning). If I want to store my ETC on a USB stick in my safe how can I do that? Haven't found an article about it yet. Download some wallet and then backup your keystore file? <SEP> @MarGul I want to do exactly the same! <SEP> @mg98 As far as I've seen you will create a wallet and then backup your keystore file on a usb stick. I will probably buy a ledger later but for now I just want it off(the)line :) <SEP> yeah i heard of that ledgers, but I think a usb stick or any kind of disk stored in safe is save anough? <SEP> I also just now created a wallet on www.myetherwallet.com and stored the JSON file and printed the paper wallet. If I store these two tings offline instead is that fine? <SEP> Same. I just wonder if ^ is good enough. the JSON on the paper wallet PDF <SEP> do you use the ethereum wallet desktop app? <SEP> No I was thinking of not even using that so that I don't have to sync. Maybe just storing the JSON and the paper wallet. Because there were places like etherscan.io where you can check your funds anyhow. I will not be doing any transaction with these ones. At least not in the beginning. Just want a safe offline storage option.

<SEP> How would ethereum work with distributive clauses from a Will or Trust? <SEP> @alanfeller_twitter what you mean? <SEP> The website mentions wills --    "This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk." <SEP> You just code the rules/logic in the will into a smart contract <SEP> yeah. <SEP> @alanfeller_twitter do you know how to write software/program? <SEP> attorney that loves technology, but not much of a coder <SEP> ok, might be hard to understand then <SEP> but put it this way <SEP> you know how computers are very good at doing exactly what you tell them to? <SEP> the input to write a program (the requirements) is similar to the input your clients give you when writing a will (or contract) <SEP> so an ethereum smart contract (program) can take the place of a legal document <SEP> and the legal system <SEP> because it enforces the rules that define it <SEP> and it cannot be corrupted/modified/overruled <SEP> the legal industry will be "automated with technology" just as many other industries have <SEP> @alanfeller_twitter check private message i will provide you some docs. and learning <SEP> that i understand - i'm interested in the mechanics of converting estate legacy assets which are held in traditional financial instruments and authorizing a fiduciary (executor/trustee) to transition these into a virtual currency set-up with the protocols of a smart contract to execute the testator's instructions <SEP> you probably need to find a software developer to work with you on this as few (if any) folks here understand your domain <SEP> probalby many issues to be resolved <SEP> the enabling technology now exists though - so its up to visionary folks to use it to disrupt their industries <SEP> @alanfeller_twitter Hey, thanks for sharing this. This is a really excellent use case. <SEP> So, the mechanics of what you want to do, more than likely, exist in the contract <SEP> But what you're looking at is someone to help develop a contract to be able to get you what you're looking for <SEP> well the contract is probably the easy part <SEP> figuring out how it connects to the existing real world is not <SEP> if all assets were eth, it would be easy <SEP> but thats not the case, so some mapping needs to exist <SEP> need to represent assets electronically <SEP> Is there a way to execute a fiat/ETH transaction through smart contracts today? <SEP> I imagine not without some help <SEP> smart contracts cannot do this directly <SEP> you need an external system that bridges to fita martkets <SEP> coinbase for example has APIs that can do this <SEP> the value to legal clients will be a reduction of possible financial fraud by utilizing a decentralized system that hopefully will be more difficult to hack - safeguarding assets <SEP> you got it! :) <SEP> @khantahirx  - Thank you

Gtter is really just chat associated with Github repositories, often the github repositories for the actual code.    Your best community is the ethermining sub-reddit, I think. On the newbie-ness, yeah, we're all newbies! RE: That download link.   Aha - right.  So yeah, that is the 0.9.41 "official" binary.   And that's the installer, right? At https://build.ethdev.com/builds/Windows%20C%2B%2B%20develop%20branch/.  So it isn't a fork - it's official, but it's really old too.    You can see at https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/releases how many releases there have been since.     Having said that, if it is working for you, I would recommend that you DO NOT change.    Using a really old Ethereum node (eth) won't even work any more, because of the Homestead hardfork, but isn't a problem for the mining code, where the requirements haven't changed.  We're still trying to work out how best to move forward with the official miner.  See https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/313 and https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/315.  Which guide pointed you at the old 0.9.41 binary?    I'm also still learning about the guides.   Given that the guides WORK, following them is the right thing to do.     It would be great if we could fix the forking and get everybody using the latest-and-greatest, and get the official miner to get the go-to-choice, but that will be a process.      Anything you can do to help educate me on what works and what doesn't, and what miners are actually doing would be very helpful.    Thanks! <SEP> @makoto Hey there.   `solc` is the Solidity compiler.    It is part of the C++ client.

You'd need to send in a bit of ETher though <SEP> https://www.google.com.au/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwjnorih45PWAhVCjI8KHSlPDAQYABAAGgJzYg&sig=AOD64_3AMlLdTnCgMMLOGyoX47ucaSsGAw&q=&ved=0ahUKEwjSjrKh45PWAhXLk5QKHaKcC8MQ0QwIJg&adurl= <SEP> That said, you're screwed <SEP> GG <SEP> wow <SEP> Check the url in the future <SEP> That isn't etherdelta <SEP> etherdelta.github.io is EtherDelta <SEP> www.etherdelta.one <SEP> THat is not etherdelta <SEP> It's a fake <SEP> You were scammed <SEP> russians have your money <SEP> You gave your private key away <SEP> yes <SEP> https://etherdelta.github.io  <SEP> do i need to change it now <SEP> Well, you lost everything in it <SEP> You can no longer use that wallet though <SEP> just status left <SEP> So yes, you need a new one <SEP> ouch <SEP> And you need to be more careful <SEP> That's a fake URL.

<SEP> hello all. can ethereum assisted icos be used for crowdfunding any kind of business, or only those in the crypto/online world? <SEP> (we have developed the world's first 100% compostable water bottle. no plastic. all plant-based.) <SEP> :) <SEP> @CompostableH20_twitter I don't see why you would need an ICO! ICO means you would be offering a "coin" or a "token" for people to use. It's not needed for your use case. <SEP> But crowdfunding, yes! Absolutely. <SEP> ah okay, thanks. can I still crowdfund with ethereum? or are you suggesting my best/only alternative is something traditional like kickstarter? <SEP> @stefanks thanks <SEP> An analogue of kickstarter might be appropriate: A simple smart contract that releases money to you if certain donation threshold is exceeded, or returns money to donators if goal is not reached. Then you can send your bottles to the donators. <SEP> @stefanks many thanks! <SEP> I don't know about the legality/taxes/etc of this. But technically, yes, you could. <SEP> @stefanks okay, will continue to research, cheers <SEP> Hey. Maybe a dumb question but can you mine to your  paper wallet? Using ethminer and just put your paper wallet public address in there?
<SEP> looking for consulting help on this can someone point me in the direction where I can find engineers to discuss elements of Ethereum, thanks <SEP> Engineer here. What are you looking for? @newswirenet_twitter <SEP> @hrishikeshio looking to write an expose on this and want to document the whole process.  The key to this article is to show the layperson that they can do this <SEP> Sure. I can help you to explain what Ethereum is and how it works. <SEP> In layman terms <SEP> @newswirenet_twitter <SEP> @bobsummerwill hey bob, I have been following your posts on Reddit :) I'm developer of Dindle, the decentralized Ebook marketplace. Wanted some suggestions from you regarding the architecture. Can you help? <SEP> sounds like a perfect question for

<SEP> Can .eth domains work like normal dns? <SEP> and resolve A or AAAA records for example <SEP> hello, I just came across to an old keystore file originated back in 2017 but unfortunately no password. Is there some way to access the few ETH's that are still located on the address? <SEP>  What's the probability that ETH will reach $10k?  Hola ya pude solucionarlo, al parecer la red estaba congestionada.

<SEP> hello everyone <SEP> why my geth in centos cost so many memory ? <SEP> the system kill it all the time by default <SEP> how much memory is it consuming? <SEP> 4~6GB <SEP> ? <SEP> when it came up to 5GB more or less ,my system kill it auto <SEP> i started the geth by "nohup geth --fast --cache=256 &" <SEP> I'm certainly no expert on it. Is it possible it has something to do with the current DDOS attack affecting GETH nodes? <SEP> maybe ? it happen today , <SEP> https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/55s085/geth_nodes_under_attack_again_we_are_actively/ <SEP> this was posted about 12 hours ago <SEP> apparently you could try running parity instead of geth. at least until the attack subsides <SEP> or rather until they fix it <SEP> T  T <SEP> thx rob , i have a try ~ <SEP> what core you are runing ? <SEP> currently checking out parity right now <SEP> admittedly im a newb when it comes to ethereum so im digging through everything trying to learn it all :) <SEP> im rawb0t on reddit <SEP> i am a newb too  , i will follow u later on reddit after i register one .. <SEP> if i change geth to parity , would it download the blocks again? <SEP> Your guess is as good as mine here :). I assume so unless they store the blocks the same way and you can point it to the same block storage <SEP> I'm running Debian 8 so I've had zero luck getting Geth to run here at all, hence my using Parity <SEP> i try it later , it time to sleep on my area(china) ~~thx again ,bob ~ <SEP> Woah, Why is the sync so slow today. <SEP> may be related to the attack
<SEP> Hello, i would like to build a mobile application. I have no knowledge of programming. Can anyone of you help me in understanding how can i make use of this palatform <SEP>   @emptycanstudios_twitter where are you learning ethereum from ? Do you have any previous knowledge of programming that is required for a complete tech dumb like me, to start a project here at ethereum ? <SEP> @hegrz Thanks for the message. OpenBazaar is the desktop application that anyone can download and setup their own stores. http://ethdocs.org contains a long list of i guess everything they do. I can read about some terms like eth, web3 but that's not all i asked. However i couldn't get answers of my questions. Any help is much appreciated. As i said, we want to make a web marketplace. Please share anybody your views about my questions above...
<SEP> hi <SEP> where i can miner ethereum.. i just know about ethermine.org, have others? <SEP> @carolineclaire you have to sync with the network first <SEP> check the progress bar at the wallet <SEP> hey guys how long its gonna take the nerwork to overcome  all this <SEP> @carolineclaire from which wallet did you send? <SEP> @mauriciogrs93_twitter scalability is worked on <SEP> i sent some ether to the civic ico and got a bad jump destination, how long is gonna take the network to get me refunded? <SEP> @mauriciogrs93_twitter since your order was canceled your coins did not leave your wallet <SEP> you both have sent from an exchange? <SEP> i sent from MEW <SEP> @mauriciogrs93_twitter whats your address <SEP> 0xa861667784217E26Ca99Cf499a5B167e4488B3bF <SEP> TxHash 0x1a5feaf3374752c6d78cbec5e07474db425ee458b65d934f9034e340c5be9d57 <SEP> I see you took part in iDice ICO, sorry for your loss <SEP> @evertonfraga how? @hegrz i use eth official wallet app for androin, from freewale <SEP> Freewallet.org <SEP> thats not ethereum foundation official wallet <SEP> isn't freewallet a scam wallet? <SEP> why, whats wrong with iDice ico <SEP> there are no official ethereum foundation wallet for mobile yet <SEP> it is a scam <SEP> What? I use it all the time though, and from ethereum.org also suggested this one, let me check again <SEP> where does it get suggested?? <SEP> @mauriciogrs93_twitter you sure the canceled tx's coins are not part of your current balance? <SEP> Hello,  how smart contracts work on ETH ? I want make platform/service <SEP> @randomppl http://ethdocs.org <SEP> tbh i dont remember my previous balance <SEP> @mauriciogrs93_twitter :D <SEP> Thank you, but one more question , to make an platform (i'll probably hire someone) do you know which programm language he need and where he gonna make it ? <SEP> @hegrz shit, i cannot see it, but i have been using it since last year, anyways, in etherscan it does show my transaction,but it said it got canceled because i have no gas <SEP> @randomppl if you want to build  a smart contract on Ethereum you need a solidity programmer <SEP> @carolineclaire so your coins did not move <SEP> @hegrz thats the problem, how do i move them? <SEP> At least return it to my own wallet <SEP> @hegrz do you know how much it can be cost ?  I dont need ONE contract . I want make service where ppl can sign contracts <SEP> Its true my eth wallet is from freewallet.org <SEP> @carolineclaire just send them to an other address? <SEP> ok <SEP> I have problems with sending ethereum from poloniex to bittrex, I'm really worried that I can do to solve this problem <SEP> @randomppl depending mostly on the complexity of the contract <SEP> wait, network is congested <SEP> but smart contract programmers are in very high demand atm <SEP> @hegrz by contract you mean platform(service) ?  I mean lets say website , one guy do something , 2nd guy promise he will pay . so to avoid any scam they can make contract.  So you think it will be more than 1k$ ? <SEP> @seviche07_twitter have patience <SEP> @randomppl yes. a lot more <SEP> I've been waiting for 24 hours <SEP> @seviche07_twitter you will have to talk to the support of your exchange <SEP> maybe the tx was out of gas, because sending between exchanges is tricky <SEP> that would mean your coins never left polos wallet but your balance <SEP> @hegrz i wanted to send them to poloniex, but i still haven't recieve my eth to my app wallet, it looks like it got stuck in etherscan (in the middle of the transaction) what can i do about it? I cant move them <SEP> @hegrz do you want me to give my hash number? <SEP> @carolineclaire how long it is "stuck" <SEP> yes <SEP> @hegrz around 9am <SEP> da18db46cf6ba01cedc583da7a83a752488cfcaa8f004ab12edf4543ffec388c <SEP> @hegrz Do you think is here like READY builds ? or at least open source semi-ready ? i mean if my budget like 2-3k $ ? <SEP> @hegrz because if here C++ i mean what if i can find some one with cheaper price <SEP> @carolineclaire your coins never left your wallet <SEP> and I would run to move your funds to a safe address <SEP> What is the hash The Txid or the address? <SEP> you can not assume your privKey is safe <SEP> @randomppl solidity is a javascript-like language <SEP> @hegrz ok, but in my wallet it said that i dont have that amount <SEP> are you sure? <SEP> send your coins to a safe address as fast as you can <SEP> then calculate your balance again <SEP> @hegrz So you mean it can be done on JS?  So like lets say , Website include blocks(boxes) or i dont know private cabinets between two ppl , where they can sign it  right?  Im sorry for asking stupid questions but i dont know where i can go to ask it ..sorry <SEP> What is the hash The Txid or the address? hegrz <SEP> @hegrz 100% sure <SEP> @randomppl no it is not JS, you are not a computer scientist, are you? <SEP> @seviche07_twitter the txid is referred to as hash <SEP> @hegrz Im not coder , i know about it as like level 1 . how everything works ,level one . My style is like Create something ,   i make idea , find who will make steps etc.. you know what i mean? <SEP> @randomppl yes I see <SEP> but skilled smart contract programmers are in extreme high demand atm <SEP> ok is  0x6929588f10671a03e4613414974069aae1fef4caa59e732ed2877abe89d06caa <SEP> you will have to offer several hundred USD / h <SEP> Can you help me why I can not find it in blockquai de ethereum please? <SEP> @seviche07_twitter that is not a know txid <SEP> @hegrz even if it easy project? like i describe before . So do you think it can be done with $3000 ? or like at least 3 yes <SEP> I would not do it but maybe you find somebody willing to build it and not making an ICO himself for it <SEP> @hegrz I understand you my friend . One more question , What languages they use ? for eth contracts  , or maybe i wil ltry learn it too
<SEP> hi there,i have an answer when running an ICO how can i mass distribute the tokens to investors instead of 1-1 ? <SEP> question sorry . <SEP> im not joking, ive been able to sync incredibly fast by spinning up a fresh AWS instance with tons of ram, cpu, and SSDs <SEP> theres a batch deposit function in 223 <SEP> @samlavery A totally different situation, different  OS, different  networking, location, etc... You have drawn the wrong conclusions from your AWS experiment. <SEP> Well, its typically bottlenecking on cpu/disk/ram <SEP> at least when running on linux <SEP> Ethereum produces  maybe 1 block every 15 seconds, not that much. <SEP> Hi, can anyone tell me  "How can i make a simple smart contract" and "what are software environment i need to setup/install on my " <SEP> Mac or PC <SEP> Please, help me!!!! <SEP> why are your questions in quotes? <SEP> bcz i am so confused that what kind of software needed to make an simple smart contract example <SEP> i followed this tutorial https://ethereum.org/cli#install-on-mac but nothing happen except running heavey script on terminal command, which my system hang and unable to work on any software

I used my password on my Eth wallet. now it doesnt work anymore!. Is there a way to reset a password on a eth wallet?? <SEP> @Hamarana_twitter no reset password function. You need to use the correct password. Do you have a backup of the keys? <SEP> if that is an automatic thing on the wallet I might have.... :-( <SEP> I don't think it's automatic.

What if I mispelled or something. I used it once . now I cant use my wallet anymore <SEP> that's weird. You should have an unlimited amount of tries <SEP> maybe a bug <SEP> I have been trying for a long time. <SEP> you need to use the correct password, there's no other way. It's encrypted for the safety of the ETH you own <SEP> This level of security is not so safe !! hahaah <SEP> way too safe.... <SEP> I think somebody created a tool to help brute-forcing a partially forgotten password. I don't remember where it is ... and you also need to be careful about getting help from strangers because they could steal your ETH <SEP> yes.. thanks for the advice ! :-) <SEP> Someone needs to build a wallet with built-in recovery. <SEP> One day if I get some time I'll write one up... just haven't gotten around to it. <SEP> Vitalik should have thought about that.. people are dumb !! hahahaha <SEP> People are dumb, but people are also untrustworthy. <SEP> Traditional banks err on the side of trusting people.  This ends up being very expensive. <SEP> Ethereum errs on the side of not trusting people.  This also ends up being very expensive.  :P <SEP> what I meant is .. there could have been a password recovery tool. <SEP> There can't be without sacrificing security for everyone. <SEP> If there is a password recovery tool, then it means passwords are available to someone other than the person who created the password. <SEP> In such a scenario, the user implicitly has to trust someone else with that information.  If you trust someone then give them your password.  :D <SEP> the opposite is also true.. not even the person who created can access it .. <SEP> That is no what I mean.. I secondary or a reminder phrase.. something of the sort <SEP> would be handy <SEP> The security of the account is only as secure as the weakest link. <SEP> So if there was a recovery process that involved answering some questions, then your password might as well just be the answer to those questions. <SEP> And generally, security questions are *super* breakable, especially when you can brute force them. <SEP> there was only one time password input.. then only months after sync-ing that it was ready to be used again .. <SEP> Last I looked, there was a note and that was it. <SEP> ok thanks . for the chat ! <SEP> It should really be banged into the users head, "IF YOU LOSE THIS KEY OR FORGET YOUR PASSWORD YOU WILL LOSE ALL OF YOUR MONEY AND NEVER BE ABLE TO GET IT BACK!" <SEP> Unfortunately instead it is more like, "you might want to back this up when convenient..." <SEP> @Hamarana_twitter Did you have a significant amount of ETH in the account? <SEP> If not you can always just create a new account.  Also, you can create a new account and if you remember your password to the old account it'll still be there (assuming you backup the key).
<SEP> does anyone know how to check balance in linux ubuntu command line <SEP> I'm not sure what "mist" is.

That is being shipped as "Ethereum Wallet" right now, as a "one dapp installation", to build up the functionality of the browser.   The Wallet is just the first dapp, but the most important one.  So you are working through https://ethereum.org/token?    If so, it will be asking for the password which you will have set up earlier when you made your account. <SEP> @xtac4u22 So you have a 32-bit Linux box (Ubuntu 14.04?) and what are you running inside the Virtual Box? <SEP> @bobsummerwill  Virtual box to run Linux over my window 7 <SEP> Virtual box creates a different environment for Linux in the same pc with windows <SEP> Why not just run the Windows clients? <SEP> since my window pc is 32 bit and there is no wallet for window 32 bits

You try to download the ethereum wallet to start the token building? <SEP> ok once we download the ETH wallet, then whats the next step? <SEP> @PopunderTraffic_twitter Go his page: https://ethereum.org/token <SEP> this is in which programming language? which backend programmer i need to hire for this <SEP> @PopunderTraffic_twitter I have a video tutorial in spanish that shows you how to make your own cryptocurrency with this page, the ethereum/token page...

I had my hard drive wiped and lost my account info on mist.  is there anyway I can import my account again without the key? or is there a way to find my key? <SEP> Hi all, I work for a company developing an ICO. I'm the chief developer so I'm looking at learning Solidity myself. In the mean time we got a quote for $40,000 and 4% of the ICO proceeds just for writing the contract. This seems steep, to put it politely. This may be a gold rush thing where people throw money at it, I don't know. Thoughts? <SEP> @johnmott59 My thought is you being in the USA need to think about avoiding federal penitentiary . The SEC just filed charges against a real estate related company and closed down their ICO. You'd need to consult a securities attorney whether or not your token/coin would be a security. p.s. How complicated is your contract? Is  it just a regular token to represent shares? <SEP> thank you, our ICO is a utility token and we have securities attorneys to help us out . we have a clear utility token use case, the token represents a value from earned activity without an expectation of value increase. <SEP> I think the contract should be a straightforward crowd sale but there is a distance between 'think' and 'reality' ;-) <SEP> I don't want to over think it but at the same time don't want to step onto a land mine because something wasn't properly coded. <SEP> @johnmott59 Sounds like you'd need some kind of mining functionality. The fact of life is you will make mistakes, i.e. need some means to upgrade your contract, i.e. use of router contracts, some other forms of upgradeable contracts. <SEP> I downloaded the Ethereum Wallet and sent 42 ETH to wallet.  Then I sent 5 ETH to Cobinhood.com to invest in ICO.  Cobinhood never accepted the transfer because I "did not have sufficient gas".  However the 5 ETH were never returned to my wallet.  And I have not been able to get a response from Ethereum Wallet support for 5 days. Who can help me? <SEP> There is no "Ethereum Wallet" support. It is not a company. <SEP> The earned value will occur outside of ethereum, the tokens are a form of payment so i don't think we need to mine. I agree about mistakes, etc, which is why we wanted to get some one that had done it once or twice. I think this is a no-brainer $200-300hr software work but can't see $40,000 and certainly can't see a percentage outside of a bonus perhaps. Am I off the mark here on the amount of software work required? <SEP> @johnmott59 Well, I know that the going price to audit someone else's contract for security and efficiency, etc... is about $30K.  One can slap together something  from all the code floating around, if you know what to slap together.  It might take a good engineer about 2 months to get the ropes. If you are a total genius,  maybe 6 weeks. How much do you get paid to be the chief developer per month? Do the math. Whoever might be willing to work for you can just as easily spend his time on his own project. I am developing two things , for example. <SEP> fair enough. You do pay a premium for someone else's learning time, and I respect that. Just didn't have a sense of the scope of numbers. <SEP> @johnmott59 I agree, however, that 4% of an ICO is outrageous. :-) <SEP> @johnmott59  it doesnt take 2 months ...neither 6 weeks, where do u get those numbers <SEP> I didn't propose the time frames for development. <SEP> i wrote mine in 15 minutes... @johnmott59 <SEP> @ingamx Certainly not from you. Are you still  looking for developers to work for free for you? <SEP> an ICO contract? <SEP> yes <SEP> @phalexo  yes, but not for ICO copntracts
<SEP> q <SEP> a <SEP> Are there any beginner projects /courses I can do to start developing with ethereum? <SEP> I've always been under the best assumption that if I    can keep to topics I know stuff about, I look smarter. this assumption has only led to the conclusion that I do, in fact, put up a ceiling to my knowledge. Now while I understand some things are best left unknown, how does one go about  getting unspoken help? <SEP> or is it really a bad platform for a dumb question? <SEP> lotta that lately <SEP> nothing like the unfiltered and full understanding,as it were, of my own weird ego. there is nothing with ill meaning about my ways. but a proto guidline could help

<SEP> hi <SEP> I'm having issues with mist lately <SEP> freezing etc. <SEP> any alternatives? <SEP> I wish I could answer all your questions, but seems difficult to get in touch with someone knowledgable about these matters.. <SEP> @bobbel98  The essence of Ethereum is :its a decentralised global computer that can execute instructions in the form of programmes or smart contracts.These programmes or smart contracts require computational steps for which 'gas' is required.Gas is charged in Ether. <SEP> I bought some ethereum using coinbase, should I move it to the wallet? <SEP> Doe anyone know a place where people can help with solidity code?
<SEP> hi <SEP> @jamesray1  Thanks for your information! Which local securities authority are you refering to? Like the police? Couldnt we trace the developers in another way? <SEP> Hi.

Is there anything that can be done to get the ETH back or at least block the address so the scammer doesn't profit from it?

<SEP> Hi.. <SEP> how long does it take for the walle to sync:??? <SEP> it is at 1.2 million 0%  and doesnt move.. <SEP> some time ago it was at 937 thousand remaining .now it has gone back to nothing.. 0% <SEP> @Hamarana_twitter it takes a pretty long time. Days sometimes <SEP> If you want to speed it up, you can use the experimental "fast sync" <SEP> What operating system are you using? <SEP> windows 8 <SEP> i missed the dao crowd fund 100 tokens because of that <SEP> hmm still 1 /100 <SEP> it does not move <SEP> I transferred 100ETH to my MIST account and its been approx. 15 hours...still no new ETH in my MIST account. Can you help? <SEP> I sent it from JAXX <SEP> it only shows in red the hours it has not moved opn again <SEP> me too <SEP> @Hamarana_twitter you can go to `%APPDATA%\Ethereum` and delete the `chaindata` directory, then go to the Mist folder, find the `geth.exe` executable, and then drag that into a command line, and put a `--fast` after it. <SEP> I sent some eth but nothing yet <SEP> You have to be fully synced for it to work <SEP> ok <SEP> @justinkelii what block number are you on? It should say up at the top <SEP> it keeps changed <SEP> 1.279,708 <SEP> 0% <SEP> *changing <SEP> I don't know why it says 0%, may be a bug. But it only needs to reach about 1.5 million <SEP> So you should be almost there <SEP> thanks!! solved the problem <SEP> @tjade273   I am not sure what block # it is currently at.  I exited the MIST wallet several times now to attempt to sync the Ethereum node.  Every time I try to Sync it, it goes extremely slow, but most of the time it just eventually Freezes...which I then exit out of syncing the node and try restart the MIST wallet again.  Sometimes when I exit the Ethereum node while it is trying to sync upon MIST wallet start up, it goes straight to my MIST wallet....this is where I notice NO NEW ETHER.... hopefully it shows up somwtime.....or am I going to have to cross my fingers and hope the ethereum nodes someday successfully SYNC? <SEP> @justinkelii it says no ether because you are not synced yet. Once you are synced they may show up. One thing that helps sometimes is to make sure your computer's clock is set properly. Make sure it is syncing with time.nist.gov <SEP> Also, you could try the fast sync process I described above <SEP> There are more answers  <SEP> @tjade273 Thank You so much.  I will be patient.  Also,  at about what time/day on this help blog did you explain how to do a Fast Sync Process,  Thank you so much for your help so far <SEP> Just now, <SEP> https://gitter.im/ethereum/welcome?at=5737677c1794136a7d08ab83 <SEP> helloK I need credit card support Ether any one can help me <SEP> pls any one help me to get credit card Ether <SEP> Ya selfish with certain info <SEP> Hello all.

<SEP> Hi <SEP> How I can buy the Etherenum ? <SEP> @atuleshjha_twitter if you want a safe solution take the official wallet! Ethereum Wallet / Mist <SEP> to buy ETH you usually need to buy BTC and sell it for ETH <SEP> Guys which exchange service do you recommend for eth to btc? And what are the min deposits? Looking for lowest min deposit.. <SEP> i say try... changelly... i prefer it over shapeshift... these are the two im aware of and i think changelly is cheaper.... ive tried both... <SEP> Ok I will try them out, and presuming you are a fellow Indian, can you tell me the easiest way of converting pool mined ether to rupees in my bank? @atuleshjha_twitter <SEP> hello guys I can't get to make an order with veri on etherdelta but with other crypto it works any help ?  please ! <SEP> why is etheruem  keep falling its value? <SEP> hi guys, i downloaded Ethereum Wallet from this web site, sent ether from coin base but my account is still 0 of balance <SEP> can you help me please? <SEP> @HrithikJ shapeshift.io <SEP> i dont mine ether...I simply buy... @HrithikJ  ... but u can make an account on ethexindia.com they provide you with a wallet in which you transfer the ethers and then sell it on their website to get money... <SEP> @prometeo101_twitter wait until your wallet is synced <SEP> @HrithikJ  Do you mine ether? can you tell me how to? I'll join the pool... drop me a message at atulesh.jha'at'gmail.com <SEP> Hello everybody. I have a question. Does ethereum use both of the PoW and PoS to mine  or just one of them now? . Thank you ^^ <SEP> @overtanned_twitter coba paje changelly disana teori bisa, cuma sy blm tau gimana cara bikin wallet disana <SEP> @overtanned_twitter sorry, try to use changelly, but i dont know how to create a wallet in there, i guess that is only to buy it, and you have to create a wallet in another place <SEP> hi, why etherum price is dropping  so much these days. ? <SEP> for ico ? <SEP> @xiaohuoban  it went up almost 4 times during the last 1 month, natural to see some correction <SEP>  ok, a good view. <SEP> You peeps complains too much <SEP> Just sit back and watch <SEP> @atuleshjha_twitter i will get back to you tomo,i have an exam tomo <SEP> i hope eth climbs above 300 usd again.. <SEP> ok <SEP> Would a desktop clock that can't synchronize with "actual time" prevent a wallet from finding peers?
<SEP> When does the next release come out? <SEP> When will there be an ethereum browser <SEP> ? <SEP> There is the Mist browser and MetaMask plugin for chrome - so there is already <SEP> Okay thanks will have a look <SEP> You need to enable the browser mode on mist <SEP> it is not ready for prime time but you can enable it https://github.com/slockit/DAO/wiki/How-to-turn-the-Ethereum-Wallet-into-a-Mist-Browser-to-use-the-Voting-Interface
<SEP> Omg i cant get into my old email pls help <SEP> Cant reset password to my old email i factory reset my phone!!! <SEP> Email me pls f4t3d.f4c3t@gmail.com <SEP> Plsss <SEP> how to mine from PC...? <SEP> Hi please can some one help me. I lost my private key. Please what can I do. <SEP> How can I revover it. Please I seriously need a help. <SEP> @ronaldpetty :Ethereum has a virtual machine baked into the blockchain, think a general purpose computer with a lot of specific blockchain functions. One  of the things you can do is mint new cryptocurrencies or tokens in Ethereum speak, so these new coins are built on top of the Ethereum network and depend to a certain point on it. A regular ICO would be making a new blockchain and mineable currency with it's own distributed network. <SEP> @KenoLeon thanks for that.  Would the new currency still in the end be using gas/eth under the hood? (part of the EVM) <SEP> @ronaldpetty a crypto currency isn't really something you can own, it is literally a number inside a database but that database isnt counterfeit able , so a crypto currency inside ethereum or outside ethereum are the same, the difference is what you can do with it, for example, if you create a new blockchain it would be independent of ethereum and you could set all the rules by which it operates and inside ethereum you should adjust to the rules and times of ethereum plus you should pay for gas prices in ether <SEP> @ronaldpetty : If you are talking about an ICO built on Ethereum, the answer is that for now it depends, it costs ether (in the form of gas) every time you interact via a transaction, and you need at least one or a few  initial transactions to make and distribute a coin. After that it gets a little more complicated, in the sense that some things don't require ether for now ( calling a function  that doesn't change state for instance), but most likely yes, transaction (buy/sell/transfer) in tokens ride on top and incur on ether costs since they do change state, hope that's somehow clear. <SEP> Thanks @gelanderos @KenoLeon , I think in the case when people say there are laucnhing there own ICO w/Ethereum under the hood, it means they are using the blockchain on Ethereum (EVM, gas, etc), but doing something like alt coins where they tied contracts to outside things?  Can a currency be build on ethereum, where the whole thing is in ethereum as say contracts (making like a state machine on top of the EVM)? or both <SEP> @phalexo I agree with that but it's supposed to be delayed and introduced baby steps so that miners who recently got into mining get a shot to recover at least part of the investments they incurred in, and of course I don't like POS but I like POW even less, there should be a reliable consensus algorithm which won't give the rich too much power like POS and that isn't as harmful, slow and unreliable like POW <SEP> @ronaldpetty You are mostly correct on the first part, although ```contracts tied to 'things'``` could perhaps be better  phrased as: cryptocurrencies have a decentralized blockchain or transaction ledger that's mineable, supply limits and other common characteristics, alt-coins in general offer a new improvement or specialization  (ethereum a virtual machine, zcash privacy, litecoin speed  etc, etc). The second part doesn't really makes sense to me;  a currency built on ethereum is a contract, and the state machine is a characteristic of certain contracts  afforded by the EVM. <SEP> Thanks @KenoLeon will think some more on things <SEP> and for a small niche currency like your burger coins that isnt a given <SEP> ok thank you. So can I ask also in the example I gave ,  to buy my token you would need to transfer 1 eth for 20 of my ERC20 tokens via a smart contract. How could you buy my token with bitcoins ?
<SEP> https://morden.ether.camp/account/70308333fc1f730c22AD9972775B9304C77A5Ee1 <SEP> `Ethereum-Wallet` can connect to `Morden` and `Main`, but I don't see a way to connect to `Test`. <SEP> Let me rephrase.  They are different networks.  I'm not sure why EtherCamp lists a 3rd network, as far as I know there are only two primary networks (main and morden). <SEP> What should i do to fix it? <SEP> Thank you. I want to start with test network becouse i want to test my smart contracts <SEP> Morden *is* a test network.  I don't know why EtherCamp has two.
<SEP> hi <SEP> Hello, how are you? many days ago I have transferred some ether into my wallet, but it is not there or at least I can't seee it  but I can see it on ETHERSCAN, anyone knows a way to send it to my ledger <SEP> Trying to send my ETH to binance, and always says "it seems this transaction will fail. If you submit it, it may consume all the gas you provide.  Also,  The contract won't allow this transaction to be executed.  Have tried adjusting the maximum fee to around 450000 gas (0.00045 ether) but still have this error message... <SEP> Hello, is there a room to talk about issues connecting to alpha casper? <SEP> Thanks Nikhil Krishnan <SEP> From where i can buy eth with fiat?
<SEP> Hi how to I change my LTC to BTC within Poloniex please <SEP> I keep getting errors <SEP> I copy the deposit address of BTC then go to  LTC into withdrawels and paste it there <SEP> @hegrz  what is that please? <SEP> is it a good time to buy?? <SEP> most of the exchanges are having problems right now - probably due to crashing values <SEP> not as withdraw <SEP> @hegrz  so when i sell it to USDT, i should use that USDT to buy BTC? is that what u mean? <SEP> poloniex allows you to exchange BTC/LTC directly <SEP> how do i do that please @hegrz <SEP> what you did is sending BTC to an LTC address <SEP> @hegrz i took BTC deposit address in Polo and went to withdraw in LTC and did it like that but invalid <SEP> your coins would be lost <SEP> click on "Exchange" <SEP> ok <SEP> what do i do at exchange? @hegrz
<SEP> Hello everyone , i want to make a project using Blockchain  Technology, i  want to implement the idea of Electronic voting system. I have read few tutorials on it , but i only found theory . Can anyone suggest me what tools do i need to download and what language should i use.I am confused.Thank you. <SEP> @Devansh-Anhal ... why? <SEP> You'll want Geth Light, Solc, knowledge of Solidity, NodeJS knowledge, and Web3 knowledge <SEP> https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/solidity-by-example.html?highlight=voting <SEP> Actually , i am new to coding , just done 6 months of java  in netbeans and a little bit in eclipse also. I am confused as i  am not able to figure out what platform(like netbeans in java) to use for blockchain. btw Thanks for the links. <SEP> Geth for the Ethereum Node Solc to compile Solidity NodeJS + Web3 to interface with your contracts <SEP> :D Thank you so much. <SEP> Also should i work on linux for this , or windows is ok ? <SEP> You just need to know how to install Geth/manage wallets. You need to know Solidity and how to use Solc. You need to know NodeJS and Web3.  You can also use Parity, PyEth, CEth. You can also use Flint/Vyper. You can also use... Python + Web3Py? I know at least Python has a Web3 port... <SEP> Linux is optimal but Windows is tolerable. <SEP> Java may have a Web3 port too... <SEP> TBH, I truly recommend Geth Light/Solidity/Node/Web3 <SEP> @kayabaNerve  Thank you so much for helping me sir . I will follow geth solidity node...

<SEP> hi <SEP> please how do i get ethereum account? <SEP> hi <SEP> does anyone know whether or not it's possible to recover a password? I thought I wrote my password down but didn't and now have 20  eth I cant access <SEP> does anyone know why i would be receiving  <SEP> Sending REP... it says in etherscan "(REP-Augur-OLD)" <SEP> TxReceipt: Fail <SEP> any advice appreciated <SEP> 0x765BDAc1bFEddF760C62F1f9cd7b0CB054b6E9c8 this is the address to whom my money were send . After is goes to diff accounts ... its crazy and mostly irresposible from your side to do nothing while people are geting robbed through your "invention" <SEP> thats a bit disconcerting <SEP> but the way I understand it you share profit so that may be what you've been seeing <SEP> I solve a block it gets shared to the chain <SEP> or are we talking payments? <SEP> Hey wassap with infinite syncing? <SEP> just bough a nice new gfx card cause last one ran out of ram <SEP> and now it seems to not stop syncing <SEP> like 7 peers <SEP> Uh Oh tech guys are saying if you make a mistake and send to wrong address gone is gone <SEP>  I mean buy the ETH <SEP> @winsseli Experiencing similar problems. My best guess is that the latest blocks on the blockchain take the longest to sync as it makes the assumption you don't need it as fast.. I'm actually redownloading the entire chain atm <SEP> @analisa122_twitter Coinbase is probably the fastest way, just make sure you transfer it to a private wallet ASAP. <SEP> Ok Thanks.. Eth may be overloaded they are also saying <SEP> due to recent surge <SEP> Whay not store on coin base not safe? <SEP> Not really, no. <SEP> The entire value proposition of cryptocurrency is that it is a trustless network. The second you store all your coins on an exchange you are immediately removing that value and reverting back to the old way of doing this. <SEP> You can both buy and sell on exchanges. <SEP> I see but always store in wallet <SEP> The last thing you want is to have 500 ETH sitting on Coinbase, then Coinbase "suddenly loses" your coins or worse, they get hacked (which has happened to exchanges before) <SEP> damn thats horrible

PLEASE HELP.. THAT SHIT WAS EXPENSIVE <SEP> @Firdos007 service of what ??? being scammed by you?
<SEP> I found a blog https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/09/22/ethereum-network-currently-undergoing-dos-attack/. <SEP> I believe it is the DoS attack and the official suggestion made such a gap. <SEP> Why there is a spike of GasPrice in Dec. 8, 2016? https://etherscan.io/chart/gasprice

<SEP> hi <SEP> Hello. <SEP> Any recommendations on how to best update Win wallett 0-5-1 to 0-5-2?  Any guidance on how to quickly and safely upgrade to Homestead? <SEP> Thanks in advance. <SEP> You shouldn't need to do anything fancy. Just download the new wallet and run it. <SEP> Cheers for that. No updates to geth, etc? <SEP> The wallet comes with a prepackaged geth binary, so that should be all you need, unless you run a standalone geth. <SEP> I would like to use both the wallet and standalone geth, yes. <SEP> Wait a minute.  Is that Mr. Hess from the Ether Review? Wow.  Starstruck. <SEP> Well, the wallet comes with geth, so you can use that <SEP> Yes, that's me  <SEP> OK.  Thanks again. <SEP> no problem, Happy Homestead :) <SEP> Cheers. <SEP> you could probably use an account you don't own too, if you don't mind not being able to access the rewards <SEP> @mactools The OS X bundle isn't signed, so you need to right-click Open it and approve. <SEP> Hey @amazonamajesty, I don't believe so, no.    What OS X version are you running?   Must be pretty ancient to be 32-bit, in which case the Wallet app probably wouldn't work for it anyway.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> Hi <SEP> hello all <SEP> something project ico <SEP> property <SEP> i bought ether during development and thought i lost it when I had m laptop stolen , I just found a file that says ethererum wallet and I have a password and ether address written down  how do i access this and see what i have
<SEP> Hi <SEP> how earn money <SEP> HI how can I receive tokens from ICOs I invested in and store in my wallet? <SEP> @rafiq34 emmm... there's many way to earn money... such as work, invest, as developer in ethereum, etc etc etc...
<SEP> hi <SEP> how are you <SEP> Hey, can anyone tell me what the current known state height is for the Ethereum blockchain? <SEP> how can mine ethereum with pos <SEP> @ToNiC77_twitter You can't. It replaces mining. In Proof of Stake you have to stake your money to get a return. In PoS, miners become forgers. <SEP> @ToNiC77_twitter pos is not implemented yet also there is no mining with PoS <SEP> ok will wait <SEP> helllo everyone  anywhere where  i can report an account , for god sake i got my account stoled today <SEP> stolen*
<SEP> @welshman182_twitter I'd help you but it has to be quick, and I assume you know how to find stuff on Win10, i.e. I wouldn't have to give instructions line by line. <SEP> well yes just tell me how to fix it and i can fix it <SEP> whats the command line you use you start it <SEP> i just click on it do not use a command line <SEP> my grandmother was nearly blind, she had a projecter thing to make words look huge on the wall <SEP> you use mix? <SEP> ah right cannot afford a projector i have less than 45 percent vision left in my good left eye right eye is dead <SEP> im wondering if that IP address geth is using is correct <SEP> reading the scrollback is funny <SEP> There are so many new people to ethereum <SEP> Speaking of new, I asked yesterday if there are any docs (must read) that people could recommend and no response yet.  Do you know any (aside the foundation related ones)? <SEP> docs for what <SEP> Ethereum (any aspect of it) <SEP> if you are serious, start with the yellow paper <SEP> https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf <SEP> Thanks, yes Im serious, not sure why you would think otherwise. <SEP> Just trying to make sure I really know the basics before claiming to know it :) <SEP> I dont trust anyone who claims to know ethereum <SEP> :) <SEP> there are tons of documents out there related to Ethereum, searching for them should bring them to the surface <SEP> but without knowing what you are trying to do, its hard to point you towards a specific area <SEP> I have of course searched, but its not obvious (to me) what the experts think is import or not.  Its not about any one thing, its like me saying if I was going to learn something knew, what are good things to read.  Not looking for one thing so yes its confusing. <SEP> For example if I wanted compiler tech, someone would say the dragon book, if you didnt know to search for dragon book you would not find it. <SEP> Thanks for the assist. <SEP> and if thats the level of understanding you are after, you wont find it in a nicely curated list of documents and papers <SEP> read everything there <SEP> by the time youre done, youll have a better idea of what you have more questions about <SEP> Cool thanks, just want to jump into things and surf till I am oriented.
<SEP> hi <SEP> Doesnt sound like it would affect the public blockchain at all <SEP> yep that sounds about right (im no expert btw) <SEP> what cheaper transactions costs are you talking about? If bank internally transfers around money, it must be even cheaper than a blockchain
<SEP> Hi Guys, anyone able to help out? https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/3093 <SEP> Hey Guys, what is the difference between the Ether Wallet and the Mist Wallet? <SEP> @LinkItUp  Ethereum Wallet is the one that stores your accounts data & Ethers you own where you can transact the Ether for any service. Mist is a Kind of browser for running any distributed applications (dApps) and it is like App Store for dApps.
<SEP> Can anyone link an article that explains the flexibility and use cases of smart contracts beyond what is found on ethereum.org? <SEP> Hello Everyone.

<SEP> Hi. I have downloaded and installed pyethereum. Q1: where is a description of the usable functions? <SEP> Also: where is the docs of the required packages, e.g. bitcoin? <SEP> Where can I find the bitcoin package? <SEP> Thanks.
<SEP> yoooo! im a trillionaire bro, and that an understatement <SEP> soon as i logged into my etherwallet.io and etherscan.io i automatically took was verified.. because im the initial source code of the entire history of the blockchain <SEP> it goes back to 2007-2008-2009 <SEP> i have 9 pages of verified creator source codes! now im pissed off and  i wanna murder everybody that took credit for everything i did
<SEP> I tried to issue a token, and am being asked for a password. What password? <SEP> Hey, @kosanke.    Sorry - need more context. Are you within Mist?   Are you following that tutorial?   If so then it would be the password you set up for your account, I imagine. <SEP> This is straight from the ethereum.org website. <SEP> I don't recall putting in a password, and I can't find one in my Dashlane. <SEP> Yes.
<SEP> 10 minutes remaining! <SEP> ! <SEP> 32 blocks / 6.5 minutes... <SEP> 9 blocks!!! <SEP> Everyone duck... <SEP> 1 block remaining! <SEP> oh god <SEP> 000!!!!! <SEP> it's here! <SEP> nice meme fireworks on the countdown page lol <SEP> ! <SEP> NOW, how do we find the new network hashrate and block reward average with uncles included... <SEP> @BeardlessDuck What meme <SEP> https://fork.codetract.io/ is the meme fireworks <SEP> no blocks found in 1.5 min <SEP> 2.5min... <SEP> we got a block. :) <SEP> they're there <SEP> :D <SEP> I think the site is just slow, can anyone confirm that the block time is correct? <SEP> sooo here we are..

<SEP> but how hardfork undo? <SEP> money is stuck on a contract. they change the contract and they set the money free, more or less <SEP> no. there is 100 eth they can't move because the contract is missing the function to move it. they add that function and then they move the money. <SEP> sorry if i asked stupid question, but i am a newbie to ethereum
<SEP> When you fisrt installed Ethereum Wallet? And how much time you left it syncing? <SEP> Light nodes are a configuration that don't store all blockchain, but just the current state (accounts balances and contracts code) <SEP> It's not recommended for PCs due being more vulnerable to double spent attacks, but I truely don't know how much is that. I don't know also if it is 100% ready for usage. <SEP> AFAIK It's recommended to use in embedded devices and smartphones <SEP> but i don't like the experience because of the way it runs at my pc <SEP> snail speed <SEP> i do not know afaik <SEP> with parity you might not notice it running, at least if it don't bugs and start consuming a whole CPU as rarely happens. <SEP> if you are 1 month without sync you going to wait a little bit <SEP> no i log often <SEP> but still since i am only experimenting with this i don't like the experience because of that <SEP> It does not starts automatically <SEP> no <SEP> you open it everyday? <SEP> how much % is now? <SEP> i closed it now and yes i open almost every day <SEP> You should wait it finish sync, so you can see the balance. <SEP> i was tryng to generate a wallet on it but i got bored because i was taking too long for this <SEP> i did that and still not there <SEP> If you are going to install parity start with `parity --warp` <SEP> also this transaction 9 hours earlier <SEP> you going to have "full" sync in like 10 minutes <SEP> (depends in your network connection)
<SEP> hi <SEP> how can I make a wallet? <SEP> hi guys, where i can buy ethereum? <SEP> @christian_truz_twitter go to poloniex.com <SEP> @banigreipenet_twitter hi <SEP> Hello ! Which address can we you to send ethereum ?

Thank  you Nour. <SEP> @viet yes, you WILL be able to using Web3.js after Whisper is enabled by default on all geth clients on the livenet. Or using Ethereum State Channels such as the Raiden Network (Work In Progress) <SEP> @indegoscott I have never used your wallet before but I assume that if it supports ERC20 tokens at all then there must be an action called "watch contract" where you can put the address of the token contract and then your tokens would appear <SEP> @lobirdlo can you paste the ether transaction Id in order to help you <SEP> I'm stuck on ethpool.org using a slow rig (it's a ridiculous situation I know) but I'mabout 70% towards completion. I've found someone on Reddit who will help me to complete this block which is ~4.5 eth + 3 eth if lucky (it's only happened one time for me). Has anybody written a smart contract for a situation like this? <SEP> thank you for that info . i have put in a ticket with Nano ledger. <SEP> Hey, just wondering who I should contact for problems with BTC to ETH transactions in my Ethereum wallet? <SEP> Basically, I ordered 0.1 Ethereum via Bitcoin in my Ethereum wallet (0.8.9) yesterday. Although the bitcoin transaction was confirmed several hours ago (and currently stands with 36 confirmations), I'm still seeing 0 Ethers in my account <SEP> Hi, so my download is suuuuper slow.

Is etherchain open source ? can I fork it ? <SEP> HI, this might be an old problem...I have ethereum blockchain # that I purchased during the initial crowdsale.  I do not have the json file associated with that purchase (I made several purchases).  I have some printed back up information like the bitcoin address I used to purchase the ether and a location file info to get the json file but that doesn't link anymore.

Do you just wait X number of blocks before considering it confirmed/check X number of blocks into the past to see if the block hash changed?
<SEP> hey guys i would like to ask something about Ethereum can i do that <SEP> Yes <SEP> do i have to import the whole string?

ETH is mined with GPUs (graphics cards) and not CPUs (your XEONs) <SEP> thats what it says <SEP> @xlcrr pm'ed <SEP> ty <SEP> @xlcrr  you can import the raw privkey, Metamask uses a different keyformat <SEP> @inKosovoINFO_twitter  forget CPUs, they are worthless for mining ETH <SEP> how can i access raw privkey? <SEP> thank you so much @lineofbestgit , @lukas-berlin are you from Germany ? <SEP> I speak German ;) <SEP> @xlcrr  hmm thats not so easy.

They have been hopping all around various channels spamming that link. <SEP> Oh, nevermind.  It has already been done.  Thanks @alexvandesande! <SEP> If the wallet stops on a block for a very long time quit the wallet and restart it. If keeps stopping on a block for a really long time. It might be good to just go and delete the whole etherium folder reinstall the latest wallet and start again. 7.2 seems to be a pretty good version.  To get it on the mac click see all versions and download it. <SEP> hey anyone actually ciled and deployed a contract to  a private blockchain? <SEP> @hugolev what toolset are you using? <SEP> is there s a way for me to explore the local blockchain to see if the contract is there? <SEP> solc on geth <SEP> @JeffreyBPetersen  ...

<SEP> Hello all! I'm looking to learn more about cryptocurrencies by learning more about the underlying structure. Are there any recommended tutorials or presentations that go over using ethereum's blockchain as a starting point?  Thanks in advance! <SEP> `mistaken113` /r/blockchain :) <SEP> @razgriz-detroit i would recommend reading bitcoin and ethereum whitepapers <SEP> @jaspervdm Thanks for the response!   I'm assuming you mean this: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper  I'll go through it now. <SEP> anyone managed to sync today?
<SEP> Hello <SEP> I want to ask something <SEP> I just download the Ethereum Wallet, it was installing on my iMac, ok it was too long because it saved all database <SEP> but then already 48hours this still download something, there are 3million blocks <SEP> and I can come on my wallet already. <SEP> so I created the Basic wallet <SEP> and I added the new wallets for contract, this show me "creating" but already second day they can't done! <SEP> what is that?! <SEP> status "Creating..." still yet <SEP> I sent ETH on Basic wallet but can't see it, this show me "for display ETH's you must add the Contract wallet" so ETh's is there? and what to do if any wallet which I push add is still "creating..." goshhh <SEP> Hello, when i'm syncing is completes but then it goes again...
<SEP> hi <SEP> sorry was just testing. I'm liking the new wallet <SEP> Can anyone help me understand why even when I sync after being offline overnight it takes 3-4 hours for 3000blocks? Because I'm not running with a SSD? or maybe it's because I'm running on wifi instead of directly connected to my modem? <SEP> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-xU5HCmbeZzVqDgnnc-OdqVnJfSsxrRZKSCLl29nNQ/edit?usp=sharing <SEP> Hey Heisenberg,  I've had sync problems too, I think it may be the cpu. Running on desktop is better than laptop <SEP> but i am uncertain <SEP> ok thanks Mark. I'll upgrade my system to a nicer pc and run a node on a ssd <SEP> @markbulmer8_twitter i'm impressed so far that as a non coder I've been able to make a few humand standard tokens. <SEP> Heisenberg are you a coder <SEP> oh <SEP> what tokens? <SEP> I'm trying to get a group of Ethereum programmers to help me with a smart-contract <SEP> just for personal testing. <SEP> i'm impressed by being able to buy digix <SEP> What function will your smart contract execute? <SEP> you can read about it <SEP> did you see my link? <SEP> basically it's a model of transferring money through charities <SEP> to ensure that the recipients qualify <SEP> Ah I read your document. So as a fundraising mechanism <SEP> So an automated verification for receivers to be vetted before receiving donations? <SEP> To create transparency and credible verification when money is sent, that can then be scaled with minimal transaction costs <SEP> yes <SEP> but also that the donor is sure that the agency doesn't skim <SEP> that once the code is in place all money is going to the verified accounts <SEP> interesting idea. but that would imply that the agency would continue to operate in ethereum all the way to the end user correct? <SEP> actually there'd be a mechanism to convert it to the local currency of the recipient <SEP> the recipient would just see dollars, euros, sheckels arriving in their account <SEP> the donors are donating in whatever currency as well <SEP> the ethereum is the middle portion that verifies the transaction occurs <SEP> as it is meant to <SEP> If I'm understanding correctly, wouldn't the idea be to verify and ensure the end receiver is worthy. and the contract creator would act as the agency? <SEP> yes <SEP> and once the accounts are deemed as worthy <SEP> the transfers occur automatically direct-deposit <SEP> interesting. So you/the owners of the contract would sell the people a token as a donation, facilitate the transfer of the donation to the end receiver, and end up in the receivers account in the form of local currency <SEP> I don't know if I'd sell a token....i'd have an interface where people are just with their credit cards or accounts transferring money to the charity <SEP> then i suppose the transaction takes the form of a token <SEP> you've got huge hurdles to automate currency conversions. for example from USD to token, token to CNY(receiver of donation) <SEP> in the middle-layer <SEP> coinbase --- shapeshift --- coinbase <SEP> does it have to go on a token? <SEP> This is where I'm not an expert <SEP> if you want ethereum to be the broker of the transaction <SEP> are you a coder? <SEP> not of ethereum <SEP> yeah i want the donor to buy ethereum <SEP> unknowingly <SEP> or a token <SEP> or ethereum <SEP> the ethereum is transferred to the qualified account but in the currencies that the accounts are in <SEP> There could be another model of transaction where the recipient is getting ethereum or bitcoin (but this would require confirmation of the recipient that they know what that is) <SEP> we need a programmer to tell us what can be done <SEP> simple enough. Sell people "Mark" Tokens USD, which you can create a smart contract for,  and then control the mark tokens wallet for them, and then transfer the mark tokens to receiver account for them, and then allow the receiver of the donation to withdraw in the funds of their choice <SEP> I could do all of the things you described without being a programmer. I would just need a bank account for the currency they're buying in, and a bank account in the currency thats being withdrawn <SEP> So that's the transfer component

<SEP> Hi is there somewhere a page explaining how to setup a private net, where I can start playing around with smart contracts? <SEP> In the sense that I can also give myself enough ETH on that private net <SEP> @GlenDC you can do that with Mist on testnet, and give yourself ether from http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/ <SEP> The problem with testnet is that I have to sync the entire net on my dev computer <SEP> and all I really want at the moment, is testing how far I can go with a decentralized app, and thus smart contracts.

<SEP> google it <SEP> ^ <SEP> "Ethereum doesn't have a hard cap.  So, I'd suggest you not to hold them for a long time." <SEP> thats what i got <SEP> that would be good because the total ammount of ether has to grow with the ammount of ether users... <SEP> otherwise they all might get shortages <SEP> It does lol <SEP> dont understand how you refer this to <SEP> how many people have coded ethereum? <SEP> It was coded by a core team of 3-8 people? <SEP> And then multiple people have dropped in, put a few lines in for a bug fix, and walked away? <SEP> wow so those 3-8 people got quite rich

<SEP> hi im new here can someone help me out <SEP> bestjane, are you asking about mining? <SEP> Adjei, we can try <SEP> ask away <SEP> @mdebelic Is your coinbase balanced decreased?  Does the transaction show on Etherscan? <SEP> @Troy517545 ,Mac,, <SEP> yes balance is 0 on coinbase and transaction shows on ertherscan <SEP> @Troy517545  see @ https://etherscan.io <SEP> ! <SEP> @mdebelic I would assume its a natural delay.  Apparently the system has recorded the transaction.  I dont know what a reasonable delay time is. Perhaps someone else does. <SEP> @mdebelic what is etherium all about and how do i make money <SEP> @billtlee Your contract is permanent. The reason behind for a blockchain technology is that the block cannot be amended once deployed as other block will keep-up from the last one deployed. Read this for some ideas @ https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/11938/how-to-update-a-deployed-smart-contract/11942 <SEP> Engine44, it has been 73days since the transaction. I have let me wallet synchronize with the network on many occasions even left the computer on for 2 days. <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> I do only have the one main account block address which is the address I used to transfer the money to. I was told by a friend that you need a separate send and receive address. Is this correct? <SEP> @mdebelic  hello <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> @mdebelic i wanna know how etherium works <SEP> @mdebelic Most people have more than one account - for many purposes, test, primary, secondary, etc. It's not a `must` to have more accounts. It's just for `fit-for-purpose` and also some `safety-precaution` for some people. <SEP> ok alice, that is what I thought. This is why I tranfered .47 Eth to test first that it is working. <SEP> Ok Adjei <SEP> Ethereum as you may know is digital money. <SEP> yes...... <SEP> how do i get it <SEP> If you want to buy it outside the US, you will need to register with a exchange such as coinbase and then purchase ETH there. <SEP> If you are in the US you can go to ethereum.org and download there wallet and purchase through the application. I am not in the US so I found all of this out by going through the process. <SEP> Adjei, are you in the US? <SEP> @bestjane  <SEP> @ragupathidjax Public network and Private network has difference purposes. Transactions/Token are transferable based on their respective purposes.

<SEP> Hi <SEP> Hey, how are you, friend? <SEP> Hey there <SEP> What do you think about the current situation of Etherium ?
<SEP> hello guys <SEP> i want to get the ether in the test net network <SEP> i'm using ethereum wallet in osx <SEP> can anyone help me please? <SEP> try this <SEP> https://zerogox.com/ethereum/wei_faucet <SEP> @jefflau do you have any video tutorial? <SEP> Just copy your address in the test network and paste it here and hit  <SEP> @FaizRasool hey, I just wrote a blog post about mining ether in testnet. https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/ether1-how-to-even-get-to-start-deploying-ethereum-d297cc68b5c7 The screenshot of the button is at the buttom of the article. Hope it helps. <SEP> @makoto thanks for the post. <SEP> i wish some one can make video guide <SEP> but if i understand the process i will :) <SEP> @makoto hey makoto, i tried mining yesterday, didnt know it takes 30 mins! so i used the faucet to do the token tutorial <SEP> @jefflau I guess the speed depends. Took a while to earn the first 1 ether, then got next 25 ethers fairly quickly. <SEP> Now I have 65 ethers. <SEP> heya. I know this question depends on a lot of factors, but how long can I expect it to take to sync the blockchain? hours? days? <SEP> ~6Mb DSL <SEP> @AnthIste on testnet or real? <SEP> I'm using Parity and didn't specify, so real <SEP> Never used Parity. I just used Ethereum Wallet. Tooks a few hours to sync testnet which has about 600,000. For real net it has about 1.2 mil and I never be able to sync on my macbook air with fiber optic band (which supposed to give me 100mb). <SEP> :| talk about a barrier to entry <SEP> I hope Parity has a pause / resume. I'm going to be switching internet sources soon (change of location) <SEP> It took about 30 mins for me on a 100mb connection <SEP> the testnet took less <SEP> using Ethereum wallet <SEP> @jefflau thanks. So I can expect about an order of magnitude slower than that <SEP> haha, well once youve got it downloaded youre only downloading the new blocks, throw it up overnight and should be fine <SEP> will there be lightweight clients in future that don't need the whole chain? <SEP> eg. for mobile phones etc <SEP> Ive heard thats one of the things that ethcore is working on <SEP> sweet. it's unfortunate that the network needs full nodes to run, but people need light clients for it to be ubiquitous and useful <SEP> thanks for the help. I'll just give it some time <SEP> No worries <SEP> Just looking at the ethcore site since you mentioned parity, looks like its on their roadmap <SEP> ! <SEP> sweet - I read somewhere about their release cycle and I don't think it's too slow (weeks not months). it'll take a while to filter through to stable, but not forever. If they keep to schedule of course :D <SEP> Well they have an Ethereum founder at its head, so I would expect you to be right! <SEP> @jefflau why it says ZeroGox: I only send some every 9 minutes. <SEP> @jefflau - There was a problem trying to send you wei, please try again in a few minutes. You can also join us in #ethereum on freenode IRC. <SEP> @jefflau  i can't make it work <SEP> @FaizRasool this is how I did on ZeroGox.  https://medium.com/@makoto_inoue/ether-2-give-me-testnet-ether-for-freeeee-8e3b02771d0b#.w56kootuh <SEP> I just mined my first 23 Ether a second ago, @FaizRasool Try clicking on develop and  <SEP> you should have some coming in <SEP> @jefflau alright - i will thanks :) <SEP> i just want to start making contracts <SEP> cant wait hehe. <SEP> @FaizRasool Good luck! <SEP> @jefflau cheers mate! <SEP> feel free to send me some test ether :sparkles:  0x7A21975ad843dfb64845E108c3034e9945be6369 <SEP> Done. <SEP> didn't got it yet. <SEP> ! <SEP> may it is on the way :package: <SEP> @jefflau thanks i got it buddy <SEP> @FaizRasool cool :) <SEP> @FaizRasool happy hacking <SEP> @jefflau just another quick question <SEP> how can you integrate these contracts to the php <SEP> or any other language lets say java <SEP> You can probably google around and find an API for them, I havent done that yet so I dont know 100% <SEP> ive had a look at the javascript web3 api, seems to interface with geth or eth, so youll probably still have to have a node running on your server <SEP> the site you given me - https://zerogox.com/ethereum/wei_faucet <SEP> is in php and using drupal <SEP> Its probably using this: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API#adding-web3 <SEP> and that interfaces with your local node under the surface, so `geth` or `eth` <SEP> I guess it doesnt matter what you use on backend as all the talking to contracts are happening on front end javascript.

I wanted to see how it's involved <SEP> Ahh <SEP> You should lookup ethereum devcon videos to get a better idea of the ecosystem <SEP> Basically my question is that is Ethereum a fully independent user based system like bitcoin or some of these theif banks are still behind the scene? <SEP> Ah..nah its decentralized <SEP> The only recognised institution at the moment is the  ethereum Foundation <SEP> Unfortunately, none of the videos that I've found so far are talking about it. If it's decenteralized, what BOA has to do with it? <SEP>  banks are secretly developing there own crypto systems <SEP> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6bhXa2-pZc&t=87s <SEP> here is an example <SEP> They all want a piece of the pie <SEP>   banks are secretly developing there own crypto systems Like Ripple <SEP> That dude dont know jacksit <SEP> Jackshit <SEP> Hehe <SEP> Only repeating what he heard to likes on youtube <SEP> hhmmm <SEP> Thats the problem a lot of misinformation out there <SEP> that's right. <SEP> All misleading. Now I'm not sure which one  I should go with <SEP> Either bitcoin or ethereum <SEP> Do you know why Ethereum transactions are way faster than bitcoin's? Isn't it related to be a user based vs server based? <SEP> Huh? <SEP> Based on what people has reported, Bitcoin transactions take over 10 minutes while Ethereum transactions take only 17 seconds. They say Bitcoin is slower because the transactions have to go through other clients which takes some times. Now if the Ethereum is using the same concept of decentralizing, why is it so faster. It looks like there is a server rather than client based database <SEP> I hope my question is clear <SEP> Bitcoin and ethereum use different algorithms...a bit technical stuff...read up stuff here <SEP> https://github.com/ethereum
<SEP> so convert to btc first then usd? <SEP> ETH- BTC will have the best rate on Bittrex but Changelly will take ten minutes <SEP> oh <SEP> okay <SEP> thank you <SEP> Use .001 ETH increments
<SEP> hello, is the folk happening does any body no? <SEP> and if it is would Meta Mask auto allocate ? <SEP> or would i need to store in a diffrent wallet <SEP> hello, I installed etherium wallet, they are in "waits of the blocks". Can I create a password to protect the application? <SEP> Hello all... I am in new this concept and i need info for how to get ETH and what is the procedure? Please let me know <SEP> hello all my etherwallet has been hacked i have never used private key onlu utc file and  paswoord <SEP> how could this have been happend <SEP> sorry, you are synchronizing the wallet says so: 4,925,406 "38 minutes since last block" what is it ?
<SEP> @thekingturko Your token contract maintains balances for all addresses. The creator address is normally given all the tokens (other distributions are possible), the token holder can then use `approve` to give a permission to the sales contract  to `transferFrom` tokens to purchasers. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Creator normally gets all the tokens, i.e. it is the creator that approves then.  "The creator address is `normally` given all the tokens" <SEP> `msg.sender` is the _from address for `approve` operations.
<SEP> Hi <SEP> what would be the best option for new wallet in Ipad <SEP> I sent 0.05 ETH to my ETH Wallet but it has not yet been completed, what could have happened? <SEP> Hello All, If i have to install a private network and create a block chain , what are ther equkirements <SEP> The scam "king token" of cryptos has caused the chaos we see today. Based on the fact that any criminal on the planet can create an erc20 token. Thanks @VitalikButerin you need to get your ass out there and do something for the community to make up for your short comings. <SEP> So I'm an idiot and transferred 2 Ether to what I thought was my wallet.  The platform says "MAIN ACCOUNT (ETHERBASE). The tokens never arrived. What do I do?

<SEP> hi <SEP> What's the conversion from H/s to MH/s? <SEP> 1000? <SEP> @Freeminds66_twitter why do you say that? <SEP> @/all We have started a Meetup/FB Forum called "The Business Blockchain" - would like to invite  you to participate - we hope to collaborate on technical/commercial/operational and other aspects of blockchains <SEP> https://www.meetup.com/The-Business-Blockchain/ <SEP> hey guys, do you know how can i do crowd sale in case my coin code is not ready yet? i just want to be able to get eth to my adress and automatically send private keys to the sender
<SEP> hi <SEP> https://www.ethereumgold.info/ Ethereum Gold (ETG) from Ethereum? they using same logo! pls confirm it`s real <SEP> I created own ERC20 token on MetaMask, how can I send it other wallet? I only allows me to use ETH account for transactions, not the added token, how to do it? <SEP> hi all 450mh it give me 0.033 Eth per day is there any thing wrong with Eth pools ? <SEP> @lucid1111_twitter if you lost your private key, your money is gone <SEP> can anybody suggest a different wallet than mist ? i was trying to sync it since ...

KuCoin? <SEP> is anyone here ? <SEP> @coinnec i don't know what you have written  in your code <SEP> @taulantimeri  depending on where your are <SEP> i am in Kosova can you tell me a little bit for the best sites to open account to trade <SEP> bitstamp <SEP> try that one
<SEP> Hi <SEP> is there a developer in here for ETH? <SEP> Whats up? <SEP> Depends on what your question is.  There is a channel for `geth`, a channel for `mist`, a channel for `ethereumj`, a channel for `parity`, etc. <SEP> Though, this is a good place to start. <SEP> uhm..... i whas told there is a proxy or something you need to ask for running ETH on exchange <SEP> @obscuren your dutch can we talk on skype or slack or irc? easier :D <SEP> @Klaasje-NL I'm not sure I understand the question, but there are several exchanges that trade Ethereum. <SEP> If you are trying to create an exchange that trades Ethereum you just need the ability to submit transactions to the network, so you just need a regular node. <SEP> @Klaasje-NL Im unaware of any proxy <SEP> You also will need to validate transactions on the network which you can either do with with your own node + code or a blockchain explorer. <SEP> im opening a exchange <SEP> and normaly i put in a config file to setup RPC username and such to point exchange server to my wallet server <SEP> I suspect building an exchange is a bit too in-depth of a topic for this channel, though I'm not sure what would be a better channel... <SEP> However, I think the answer to your question depends heavily on how you setup your exchange infrastructure. <SEP> yeah dont want to discus all of that in public chat ;) <SEP> Good afternoon. How can I talk to Vitalik  Buterin? <SEP> I want to create a project on the Etherium platform. I need an experienced supervisor who will help me to organize this work at an early stage. <SEP> There is a crazy idea to organize the Upwork on the Ethereum platform. <SEP> I need your help and advice how to start this project. <SEP> https://gitter.im/nn1k1kvn/EthWork <SEP> I would recommend starting with the ethereum programming tutorials. <SEP> Or if you aren't a programmer, draft up a proposal and/or some mock-ups and see if you can get funding from the DAO to hire a developer. <SEP>   Thank you. I will do as you advise me. @Zoltu <SEP> Hello. Are there any good documentation for non coders to download wallet, buy ether, and play with some existing Dapps? <SEP> @Vingika_twitter https://medium.com/@DomSchiener/publicvotes-ethereum-based-voting-application-3b691488b926#.cm3ul9a70 - demo: http://publicvotes.org/
<SEP> hi <SEP> please can some one tell me more about ethereum and how to register <SEP> ?? <SEP> I do not watch the news, please tell me if there is any problems? Over the last few hours the price fell ether and it seems there is some delay in the confirmation of blocks ps sorry my bad english <SEP> Hello all. How a programmer can work with ethereum.org? <SEP> @saturnomangieri_twitter u can mine or trade <SEP> or write and deploy smart contracts. <SEP> Hi, I've been trying to sync mist wallet but the last 500,000 blocks take forever. for the past 2 days it only syncs 30,000 blocks/day. I run geth client on background with this command geth --datadir C:\Program Files\Geth init testnet_genesis.json; geth --datadir c:\Program Files\Geth --networkid 3 console . Is there a problem with the mist update or am i doing something wrong? <SEP> petrosmit :  open a command promp and and type <SEP> cd  C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum Wallet\binaries\Geth\unpacked\geth-windows-amd64-1.5.2-c8695209 <SEP> this should put you in the right folder where geth is then type <SEP> geth removedb this will delete the block chain <SEP> then type <SEP> geth --fast --cache=512 --maxpeers 75 --jitvm this should start downloading the Bock chain again from scratch and will take approx 3-5hrs depending on your connection speed <SEP> DON't open Mist or the ether wallet (depending on witch one your using ) until it completly finishes . Sometimes it may get stuck and if you stop it syncing and then restart it ,it will not download quick (fast) and slows right down. The fast command does not work if it sees that you have some of the Block chain , you have to delete the Block chain and start again <SEP> The first 750,000 blocks should download in approx 30 mins on a T2 Fibre connection and then it does slow down but that is more the fact that there is bigger blocks . Also at about 2,870,000 you may notice it 's downloading the  file structure witch is 19 million + (not shore if it's actually Blocks or just data) and will take about 2 hrs , the Block chain as of today  is 15 gig  so it does take some time and the slower your connection is the longer it will take <SEP> kin63campa NO there are no problems with ether other than there is a new update for the wallet and Mist and people may have expected that there would be trouble however this time it went smooth and there is no problems i have left some intructions for noobs to help them update without any problems as they did change a few things like not having a .exe  file that installs the update but that is probably because there was trouble with that in the last few updates . Mind you a bit more instructions at the gethub site may have helped <SEP> Jernej Cernalogar  Copy your keys from the ketstore  to a seperate folder somewhere or a flash rom stick and that will make shore you won't lose your money  you will find the ketstore in C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Ethereum\keystore  for windows. Once you have the latsest Mist or wallet sorted you can copy your keys back to the ketstore and the wallet should just pick them up and your balance should be correct . Also read my earler posts on how to update , i have already updated and copied the new file to the Mist folder and had NO problems syncing in fact it's faster than the older version so well done guys <SEP> John Threat follow my instructions  that i have posted for Jernej Cernloger <SEP> John Threat you can tell witch ether you have  from where you may be mining from  if it's from ethermine.org then your mining Etherhash  if it's from etc.ethermine.org then it's Ether Classic . Also if you used geth  1.4.11 and did not use  --support-dao-fork in the command line  then your Block Chain is Ether Classic and not Etherhash . You need to use  --support-dao-fork . If you have the latest  geth 1.5.3 it should automatically be following the dao fork  and would mean your Block Chain is Etherhash <SEP> odutola kamoruden When you load Mist or the Ether wallet it will ask you once it's running and syncing to open a account . You will be able to by ether at this point  just follow the on screen instuctions , However you do not need to buy ether to open a account , you just wont be able to make a contract until you have at least 1 ether in it <SEP> ops John Threat sorry follow instructions i gave for  petrosmit my bad sorry <SEP> @beaver25  Thank you so much for your input.  I do as you say , i deleted the db and run the command but after 5 mins it stops. this is the last thing that shows: goroutine 21658  <SEP> petrosmit  : what version of Mist or wallet are you using ?  If you have geth version 1.4.11 you will need to use this command line after you delete the block chain and start again : geth --fast --support-dao-fork --cache=512 --maxpeers 75 --jitvm  i have had trouble when i have not used the --support-dao-fork command so try again .  I think you can't get around not downloading the whole chain before you deploy a contract  . You could try uninstalling everything and restarting the system and then reinstall Just mist but install 0.8.7 and that way i know you will have all the right programs in the right places  . However i would remove what is in the Mist folder in c:\user\yourusertname\AppData\Local\Mist and copy the new version 0.8.8 to the Mist folder you have just deleted don't remove the folder Mist just what is inside it . You can download the new version and just unzip it to any folder you wish , it's the contents of the folder you copy and paste to your Mist folder in C:\users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Mist . Don't run Mist until you have  replaced the Mist contents with the new versionif you do it this way don't run geth  just run Mist and let it download . If you still having trouble i would check your connection to see if it's dropping out and contact your ISP .remember if you stop it from downloading you will have to start from scratch as the second time you start it it will not download fast if you have not deleted the chain <SEP> Jim i would not worry about using the program you said . Just use switch fast and convert the Classic ether to something else like light coin or Bitcoin and wait till the price improves a bit and then use Switch fast to convert the light coin or Bitcoin back to ether  just be mind full of the prices when you convert it if you do it right you may even end up with a few more ether and not lose anything <SEP> Jim : however that would mean you will need another type of wallet i would go with Bitcoin and don't download the whole node type of wallet just download one of the  app based types that don't need you to download the whole Block chain or open a online wallet to get a bitcoin address to do the convertion i have used this site to do such a thing :   https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/ <SEP> I guys ! i'm on the blockchain concept but i don't find an really good tutorial  about it. the goods ones seem to be not free (no at all ). Any advice ? <SEP> The long ethereum stack exchange meta post you should read evaluating 2016 community status and giving useful hints for 2017
<SEP> Hi I am a newbie. Where can i start is there a good developer resource and documentation? <SEP> http://ethdocs.org <SEP> Thanks a bunch. Very exciting technology hopefully start contributing to the code soon <SEP> Is it possible to issue a token and then send certain amount of ethereum to coin owners. For example is Alice owns 4 my token and Bob owns 6 of my tokens I want to send in total 10 Ethereums to my token owners, in this example Alice will receive 4 Ethereums and Bob 6 and I want to repeat this action every month. Can someone tell me if it is possible to make this kind of contract? <SEP> certainly possible
<SEP> Dear Ethereum, I want to open a wallet, how can I do that? <SEP> @Chokotoff check Kraken it is good wallet <SEP> `Quiark` it's an exchange but whatever <SEP> sorry <SEP> thank you for your advise @hegrz I am completely new to crypto, I will see if I find it <SEP> I can't open the wallet because it's not from an "identified developer" ? <SEP> (Mac) <SEP> (Sierra) <SEP> ok thanks. Why are the developers not "identified" ? <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter go to System Preferences , security and  allow apps downloaded from... <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter Because the app is not downloaded from Apple Store <SEP> @BrianZebeaune_twitter because apple want you to have apps just from apple:) <SEP> @hegrz nut it takes 21 hours? <SEP> @OttoBubenicek_twitter Good one! :) didnt know that method <SEP> no, something is wrong <SEP> maybe fee to low <SEP> There are apps outside the App store that are built by identified developers. <SEP> can you post the address of the wallet <SEP> @OttoBubenicek_twitter Btw, if i do that: go to System Preferences , security and allow apps downloaded from...  How secure it is? <SEP> no money to pay apple to take the software in their store <SEP> @freespins_news_twitter depend which app you want to download. Sometimes a normal app can be also mark this way...
<SEP> hello <SEP> someoen can help me regarding ethereum <SEP> have some questions <SEP> @KingScorpio you can start learning about solidity and Ethereum dapp building here : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3Rrg2t4PZ59Sna497DUZA?sub_confirmation=1 <SEP> i want to know about the new changes on the plattform how are transactions now feed? <SEP> boa damn this chat is so dead whats with ethereum is it dead now? <SEP> @KingScorpio This chat is slow; Ethereum isn't dead. <SEP> The #2 rating on CMC proves that. <SEP> #2 is only because index mafia refuses to list coins with higher marketcap <SEP> LOL. There isn't a coin with a higher market cap than Ethereum (besides BTC). <SEP> Feel free to prove me wrong. <SEP> thats not true anyone can create a "coin" with a higher marketcap <SEP> ... what. <SEP> marketcap = price X total available supply <SEP> Marketcap is a mix of coin supply and price <SEP> not a mix its a product a multiplication you milkdrinker... <SEP> ... <SEP> You just want to insult people or do you want ask questions? <SEP> the index mafia prevents listening of coins that have a huge supply but a huge price in order to protect the bitcoin centristic world <SEP> i am telling you how the index mafia works <SEP>  whats an index mafia <SEP> I know how CMC works. You're forgetting something though <SEP> @annonch CMC <SEP> ohm jes and CMC is same scam <SEP> as i said higher marketcap is easy, its just prize times supply <SEP> I can create an ERC20 with 5 trillion coins and sell one to a friend for a dollar. That doesn't mean my coin is #1. It needs mass trading and circulating supply should also be taken into account. <SEP> nope thats not true its marketcap is then #1 <SEP> it would get mass circulation and supply if it would be listed on the point of attention <SEP> I didn't mean #1 marketcap <SEP> but index mafia as i said prevents that to protect their bitcoin miner centristic world <SEP> I mean #1 as in most current economic value <SEP> what is "current economic value"? <SEP> You're trying to bring up problems unrelated to Ethereum to be problematic. Do you have questions I can try to answer or should I leave you alone? <SEP> i asked at the begining about ether <SEP> @KingScorpio hello someoen can help me regarding ethereum have some questions <SEP> And I'm asking what your questions are. <SEP> is it decoupled now and not needed on ethereum network like media are saying? <SEP> What's "it"? <SEP> ETHER <SEP> You never clarified that. <SEP> People are saying Ether isn't needed on the network and everyone could just set a gas price of 0 and move on. <SEP> so whats with Ether is it the gas not anymore? <SEP> No. It is the gas. People are saying miners don't care about the gas fees. <SEP> gas price of 0 is possible? or is it now a gas price as percentage of transaction sum <SEP> It is possible. <SEP> but for creating a smart contract you need ether still? <SEP> ... nope. You need gas. You pay what you want for gas. <SEP> It was never 'needed'. <SEP> But you won't get your TX mined <SEP> It's a half truth. Ether is still needed. Even if miner's didn't care about the gas fees, everyone would have to switch for 0 gas fee TXs to be processed. <SEP> That said, miners do care. Gas fees surpass the block reward, last I checked. Increasing the block reward increases inflation. <SEP> so there is now the option to do transaction for 0 ether? <SEP> in theory but not practically <SEP> There always was, however, your TX won't be mined for a long time. <SEP> Gas prices incentive miners to mine your TX. With no incentive.. <SEP> and thats it but ether is still the gas of ethereum plattform? <SEP> Ether was never gas. It's a utility token to pay for gas. <SEP> jes and then people in social media showed up and said ether is going to drop <SEP> where did Vitalik say this?
<SEP>  <SEP> :-) <SEP> @alexvandesande is it still profitable to mine ether? <SEP> I have no idea. <SEP> I dont know much about mining <SEP> No idea? <SEP> Why no idea? <SEP> try reddit.com/r/ethmining (or something like that) <SEP> I never mined outside the testnet <SEP> What's a testnet? <SEP> its a test network <SEP> thank you ! <SEP> @biafra23 RE: Android.   Just have that discussion directly on https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum.
<SEP> ? <SEP> obviously ether goes up the more people are transacting on the network <SEP> Imagine 70% of all USD being a digital token <SEP> or they could be drawing attention to the fact bitcoin has a few more bells and whistles than just transaction and ethereum had to split because of security concerns,and bitcoin's value is more <SEP> To me , ethereum and bitcoin are both necessary as checks on one another
<SEP> so how likely am i to get a block in nanopool? <SEP> with a rating <SEP> like what's the average time
<SEP> So hire a marketer <SEP> Or at least peer review your paper <SEP> Thats it... most of them have great marketing team ....... <SEP> Yes. Marketing teams are worth stuff <SEP> It's why you hire marketers instead of getting that stuff for free <SEP> but does marketing team write software ? <SEP> They can <SEP> Depends on who they are

<SEP> hello <SEP> HEllo Lovely people . I wonder if you can help me . I am running Ethereum Wallet version  0.10.0 on a main network (MacOS HighSierra Version 10.13.4 ) and trying to download Main Network Block chain . but unfortunately the download stuck. I can see that only 65 blocks left but its been like that for more than 72 hours . I have done the research and it seems that it is a common issue but not alot of information on how solve this issue. I have managed to download the lightchain with the following command geth --syncmode light --cache 512 but as it is light mode  miner.start(*) function is not supported hence this method is not usable for me. So ladies and gents could give an advise any help will be much appreciated !!!!

I have a lot of the Chain Structure downloaded but realize I have a LONG way still to go.  Can I launch the application while its downloading, and the chain continue to download? <SEP> @Caloaks  I'm not an expert, as I've just started as well, but I believe you're "syncing" to the chain. It takes a couple days to sync up. During that time, you'll want to get your wallet installed and ready to go as you'll start accruing ether once you're synced and have begun to mine. <SEP> Hello All, <SEP> I'm new to Ethereuem,Can anyone let me any starting point for Ethereum to develope smart Contracts and deploy in distributed environment ,To check if data is getting  replicated in the distributed environment ? <SEP> welcome to ethereum, @smfaizalkhan ! try these links: https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/a-101-noob-intro-to-programming-smart-contracts-on-ethereum-695d15c1dab4  http://ethereum101.org/ <SEP> Okie ,Thanks @jamesdwilson <SEP> you're welcome. pay me back by returning with what you've learned and asking more questions! <SEP> Sure @jamesdwilson <SEP> Hi guys, having some trouble installing hte ETH wallet (node.dll is missing), does anyone know where I can find an FAQ like section?

<SEP> @hegrz Hi Hergz, what should be the level of my wallet holding to earn something like 2 eths a month? any estimate? <SEP> once PoS takes place <SEP> @shashboy that depends on the factor how many other wallets are staking their coins <SEP> @hegrz Hi hergz , my question was, as to how many eths must i stake so that i earn 2 eths a month? <SEP> thanks a ton hergz <SEP> live long and prosper <SEP> so with fees and 5 ETH reward, very much over the thumb, 200 ETH for 2ETH/month <SEP> but won't happen in the next few month <SEP> you have to consider that the block reward will probably get changed and will decrease

I don't see it and i cant find it when searching my c drive <SEP> FYI ... Talking with @blackknightsatelitte on the cpp channel now. <SEP> @jstreanor What OS are you using?    Some more info on the "innards" of the data directory here - <SEP> See also https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Backup-&-restore <SEP> @jstreanor it's under %APPDATA%/Ethereum <SEP> So it should be in %APPDATA%/Ethereum for you. <SEP> Just copy the `keystore` folder somewhere safe, then delete everything and start over <SEP> Just don't delete the keystore folder if you care about your keys <SEP> i could just delete the install and reinstall? <SEP> its 64 bit <SEP> No need to do that, plus it likely won't work <SEP> Just go to the start menu, put in %APPDATA%/Ethereum <SEP> It will take you to the right folder. Then just delete everything there, and start `geth --fast` <SEP> @jcfa01 "hello guys have any of you experience your block restarts to 0? because i have. any solution to this?" That usually happens to people when they end up switching between different Ethereum clients (because they don't share blockchain data).     If you ran the Ethereum Wallet first, for example, that will launch a bundled instance of geth, using a Mist-specific data directory.    If you later ran `geth` standalone then it will be using a different data directory, so start from 0 again.   Ditto if you started running `eth`.    Did you do any of those things? <SEP> @tjade273 thank you found it. <SEP> do i delete the folder and contents, or just contents <SEP> ? <SEP> Doesn't matter <SEP> Geth will recreate it if it doesn't exist, or just use it otherwise <SEP> great, thank you <SEP> @bobsummerwill  nope, i didn't i just keep restarting etherium wallet because it wont finish syncing the blocks even though I finished downloading it. is there a way to get it back? so i won't a day or two to sync again? thanks for the help. <SEP> No - I think you've just got to stick it out, @jcfa01. Or you could install `geth`, and just `geth --fast`. If you have stopped your Mist, do that geth startup, and then restart your Mist it will attach to that geth node, which should sync a lot faster than 2 days.
<SEP> Hello, why are all these transactions pending? https://etherscan.io/txsPending <SEP> Definitely no trojans in the chaindata @staltz - i can definitely assure you. the chaindata contains no code to be executed. of course, that would actually be a pretty neat idea, to put bad stuff on the ledger and tell a trojan where to find it in your chaindata and how to interpret it, but.. this would have to be tailor-made and pretty elaborate :D <SEP> @cse33 because they, for some reason, have not been mined. not enough gas send, insuficient balance, bad stuff provided as data or input.. god knows ;) <SEP> @nikita-fuchs I'm asking because I send a transaction, used max gas in Ethereum Wallet and it took about 30 minutes until the transaction was sent (it was pending during  those 30 minutes). I have no idea why it took so long... <SEP> @cse33 that's just the condition of the network right now probbably. once we have more miners, faster node clients, etc... things will hopefully work faster. ask this Question in http://ethereum.stackexchange.com/ please, as I'd also like to get some profound information on this topic, too, by someone more into the technical details of the network. most of us are just developers here :D

Thank you <SEP> @ADVFNBrasil_twitter : Ethereum incorporates a virtual machine in it's blockchain that allows for attaching behavior to the currency, think of it as if your bills and coins could hold information, talk to other bills and coins and do certain things on certain dates or under certain circumstances. <SEP> This virual machine, basically a computer running on a blockchain allows for novel uses of crypto currencies, mainly smart contracts and tokens which Bitcoin does not have natively. <SEP> @ADVFNBrasil_twitter There are other technical differences, but in short you would invest or buy Ether if you believe there will be a market and use of these additional features. <SEP> @ADVFNBrasil_twitter Is that clear ? <SEP> @KenoLeon Yes! <SEP> I like @KenoLeon 's answer.

<SEP> Hi all - does someone have a link to images / collateral for ethereum? <SEP> I know i've seen really slick designs of logos etc. <SEP> When I right clicked on the file it must have already been unzipped since a few dozen files appeared.  I never got any warning from an antivirus software.
<SEP> hellow <SEP> Hey, so how do I go about if I'd like to buy Ethereum? <SEP> Use Coinbase or Gemini. Those two would be easiest but you do need to link up your bank or wire deposit money to buy Eth. <SEP> is Beth ICO a scam? <SEP> @hegrz it would not be investment decided by the investors. <SEP> Good day! I've been using Ethereum Wallet for a while now on my Windows 10 machine. In the past every now and then I got an error trying to start the Ethereum Wallet, which disappeared upon restarting the wallet. But now for the past few days, I keep getting this error. On the small wallet box I see  `Ethereum node connection error :'(` and I get a pop up:   <SEP> Hi, does anyone know if there's a process for freezing fraudulent eth wallets? A company called bit.ac have taken alot of peoples eth - approximately around 50k at the moment. If a criminal investigation is opened do governments have power to freeze wallets? The comapny in question is registered in the UK <SEP> governments do not have the power to freeze wallets <SEP> nobody does <SEP> okay thanks <SEP> hi, I'm looking to create a raw Transaction offline, and broadcast it using json rpc sendRawTransaction. is there a way to sign Transaction to create Raw Transaction in Java or Scala <SEP> governments DO have the power to raid the place, seize all the computers and try to prevent them from liquidating the assets <SEP> but the blockchain itself cant be altered by one single actor <SEP> certainly not the UK government <SEP> How about Europol? <SEP> they've frozen bitcoin accounts in the past? <SEP> why is ethereum different just out of interest? <SEP> if you have funds in a wallet managed by a company <SEP> then that company can be ordered to not process your transactions <SEP> but if you hold the wallets themselves <SEP> then nobody can prevent you from spending whats inside <SEP> thanks very much for the info

I use MAC IOS <SEP> @josemmp1966 some ios update inbetween? <SEP> `rich_security` Anyone know why Coinbase is reporting a partial ethereum outage?

<SEP> Hi guys. Very new here, hope you can please help. I have done a transfer from bitcoin to Etherium Wallet yesterday. The transfer went through completely, but there's nothing showing in my account / wallet. How long does it usually take to show <SEP> Waiting for same answer. I was told two days but still nothing for me. <SEP> @TheSquiggler1_twitter  I'm pretty sure you can't transfer bitcoin into an ethereum wallet <SEP> I did it via ShapeShift and it looks like you def can, ie it gives steps for choosing currency with bitcoin as an option, then shows you the address for the transfer and tells you that the btc will be converted into eth once the funds are received. <SEP> Looking at Chritopher's problems, it looks like I'm the same. I'm 6% into updating the blockchain, perhaps after that <SEP> Unable to connect. Please start geth using: |geth| Make sure you set your IPC path to the default one, when using a different (datadir , e.g. Geth --datadir ... ipcpath /users/your user/library/ethereum/geth.ipc etc.. optional add: --unlock  <SEP> @floriodavidd_twitter I was getting that --unlock  <SEP> Man. I really should've figured this all out before transferring money.. <SEP> I've got some Humaniq tokens on thier website I want to withdraw. I tried to download the Myetherwallet. I got the JSON file but dont know what to do now. Can I hold my token in this browser some how?
<SEP> hey guys <SEP> is etherdelta still stuck? <SEP> i used it about a month or so ago? <SEP> Can I have an ETH wallet my android phone? <SEP> Can I have an ETH wallet with my android phone? <SEP> @obazeepa_twitter  yes. e.g. walleth <SEP> Thanks, please the link <SEP> Hey all ... just trying to get Ethereum wallet installed on my Mac and having serious issues with completing the sync... can anyone clue me in? <SEP> is etherdelta still stuck? <SEP> I want to download  ethereum wallet    and register using andriod phone , is it posible
<SEP> no i didnt <SEP> in eth 1 transaction can have multiply addresses like recipients? <SEP> unconvertable <SEP> unconvertable
<SEP> Forgive me for asking such a newbie question, but I downloaded the Wallet and there is a meter at the top that's been filling up slowly. Is there a succinct documentation or layman's version of what is happening? I don't know what it's for. <SEP> I was told to share my address for the testnet, but I had to run and errand and since I was gone 81% of the meter is full. <SEP> @noah thats what I heard about them going up against the 1080 but i think i read somewhere they have two different cards.. one being the less powerful one and the one to compare to the 1080 which i read its still going to be pretty expensive, but thats all speculation since it seems no sources have any idea of the price tag at this time. <SEP> @VERTlG0 PRetty much what I've heard as well. I do remember seeing a thread on reddit about a preordering the dev version of Vega for something like $1,100. There was one user in the comments suggesting he was going to bench it. <SEP> @sean-marshall-733 The meter in the middle filling up represents your 'sync status' . It's represents how much you've downloaded of the blockchain <SEP> I created a custom token and the minimum fee to send this on the blockchain to someone is .04 ETHER.. It seems a bit excessive.  Anyway to get this amount down? <SEP> thats the price for a contract of this complexity lower the payload or bid less gas and hope somebody mines it <SEP> The cheapest option I get is ,o4 <SEP> .04 <SEP> I cant lower it anymore than that. <SEP> its just a standard token contract <SEP> deploy it on testnet if you just want to play around <SEP> @michaeljyeates another ico site https://www.icoalert.com/
<SEP> pls how do i log into my ethereum account? <SEP> You don't have an ethereum account you have either a wallet on an exchange or wallet on you device such as computer hard drive, phone app or cold storage device like Trezor or Nano -s . <SEP> Any account would be with the exchange you trade on or on line wallet such as MyEtherWallet. <SEP> I sent coins to the address wallet of the Ethereum Wallet.I do not see them because synchronization is very slow.I have an account on MyEtheriumWallet.How can I see my coins on MyEtheriumWallet from the Etherium Wallet adress? <SEP> All you should have to do is log on to MyEthereumWallet go to your wallet and check the transaction history to see if they got the coins. you can also check with the Ethereum Blockchain Explorer to see if the coins got sent. <SEP> What is the total amount of tokens that can be mined? <SEP> It depends on what token you are talking about they are all different but you can check by going to  https://coinmarketcap.com/ and navegate to the individual coin page there you will see the  data for each coin or token <SEP> For etherum coinmarketcap doesn't show a total <SEP> Go to the source https://www.ethereum.org/ <SEP> Tokens came to adress of the EthereumWallet, but I do not see them because synchronization is very long.Can I use the address with my tokens of the EthereumWallet in MyEthereumWallet? <SEP> @levcoin88  Not sure what you are asking but I think you will need to wait for sync to happen then you should be able to see it on  the blockchain explorer. all transactions have to verified before they post. <SEP> Also where did you  send them from? I have a similar situation where I sent ETH from bitstamp to Cryptopia and it has been over two weeks and I still have not seen them. <SEP> Afternoon guys hey how do i get my money out of etherscan? its stuck there cause my wallet is taking forever to finish. thx in advance <SEP> Etherscan is a Blockchain explorer you cant do anything with that except look at transactions on the blockchain. <SEP> The only way to move crypto is by the interface on your wallet whether it is on an exchange or hard device app such as phone, comp hard drive or vault such as Trezor or Nano-S. and having the privet key.
<SEP> Guys, do any of you know any societies in London for blockchain and cryptocurrencies where you can meet people in-person? I was doing lots of research myself about blockchain tech and really want to speak directly with experts and enthusiasts to gain better knowledge about it. Thanks. <SEP> `Quiark` there should be ethereum meetup <SEP> Do you know about any or where I can lookup them up? <SEP> `Quiark` meetup.com <SEP> Found some, thanks! <SEP> Why ETH price down <SEP> `Quiark` so that you can buy <SEP> i have ETH price 360 i lost price so sad <SEP> i not under stand why eth price to down <SEP> `Quiark` if it makes you nervous maybe you have too much money in it <SEP> Question: if I check an Ether balance on an old "ether sale" address.. will it show accurate amount still available?   Or just original purchase amount no matter what?

Someone here can help me please? <SEP> haha @phalexo it's nice up here! 300 days of sun! <SEP> @OhTheSuspense_twitter Is Tibco doing anything in the knowledge systems space? <SEP> @OhTheSuspense_twitter Sure, 300 days of hard ultraviolet. You are just begging for melanoma. <SEP> @phalexo I don't believe so <SEP> @phalexo We are selling what we call the insights platform, which is just a few of our products combined. basically a full tibco stack <SEP> nothing to what a knowledge system is <SEP> What does it do? <SEP> @phalexo  I'll let our marketing team speak on my behalf, https://www.tibco.com/solutions/tibco-insight-platform <SEP> I wanted a non-fluffy description. <SEP> figured you would <SEP> anyone have any knowledge on how to get in on pre-ico of Bankera <SEP> basically, we combine a few of our products. TIBCO (The Information Bus Company) at its heart is integration, so we help connect disparate systems. once they're connected, we use streambase to affect customer behavior (I.E. walk into macy's and app notices you buy lots of shoes, gives you contextual offer on shoes in the brick/mortar store), finally they utilize spotfire (data viz) to understand what all just happened <SEP> Does the app assume you have a shoe fetish? <SEP> I see. This is just mainstream data science kind of thing. <SEP> I am more interested in how we the public and corporate workers consume information. <SEP> that sounds like a heck of an API conversation <SEP> Why API? <SEP> consuming information was the buzz word for me. How companies expose their information through API's <SEP> I don't know. <SEP> Let me show you <SEP> http://developer.edmunds.com/ <SEP> I know one thing, there is too much of it, and one has to wade through a lot of crap to find nuggets. <SEP> Is Edmunds the same company as Edmunds Scientific? <SEP> no, this is Edmunds cars <SEP> in their FAQ, they do a great job of explaining why companies should be exposing their data <SEP> http://developer.edmunds.com/faq.html#faq-2 <SEP> being able to call an Uber in Google Maps is also a great example of API's being put to use <SEP> I wonder if there is going be any task left for our brains to do. <SEP> We use the story of a hawk, in order for a human to keep up with one, all we need is a bike. The bike augments our body. I think in the future, there will always be software tools like the bike, but you still need the human legs to move the pedals

Few months ago, i had a ethereum wallet + few ethereums on it. But then i reset my laptop and now i deleted also all passwords and files...  Is there any change to get back my wallet and the eth i have on it?  This is the only thing i see now. <SEP> @dinkeltje you have a keyfile and a password to decrypt the file. You need both to access your ETH. Did you try file recovery? <SEP> @dinkeltje  feel free to pm me <SEP> @lukas-berlin i sende you a pm <SEP> @dinkeltje  may force be with you <SEP> @dgourlay_twitter There is nothing to resolve here. Those JSON files contained private keys, and without those no one has control over the account that contains that Ether. If you are really lucky maybe the sender kept a backup of bounced e-mails.

<SEP> hi <SEP> Hey, can i do a smart contract chain, that will reference itself. on eth? <SEP> @IuriiChizhov1_twitter Do you mean calling a contract in a circle. Thats possible but your call will simply run out of gas. Its like writing ``` while (True) ``` <SEP> GM! Important Announcement to make!

Is there a way to reverse that transaction? <SEP> @jtmoody Nope, that is the main point of blockchains, they are append only.  Have you checked etherscan.io?

Useful read @ https://codeburst.io/build-your-first-ethereum-smart-contract-with-solidity-tutorial-94171d6b1c4b <SEP> @AliceTheHive The fastest way is to get someone who knows what he is doing. Hm. Finding those people might be a long process though. <SEP> @phalexo Emmm... Wonder any of those `someone` would come  forward an advertise him/herself here... :smile:  Then he/she would make good :moneybag: <SEP> @legeend6_twitter  <SEP> @AliceTheHive Although in general it might not be a bad idea, but here 99.999% of potential "customers" are total flakes. They think they can get things  done for them for a few pennies, with none of it paid up front. I am about to sign a contract with a company that does professional Solidity development, and they ask their customers for 50% up front to make sure the customer is not a flake. <SEP> Another company with which I spoke charge $25K for normal audits (like a crowdsale contract audit) plus $5K for rush orders. Try to tell this to people here. :-) <SEP> @phalexo WOW... LOL...  :laughing: <SEP> @AliceTheHive What you see here is mostly "I want to be fabulously rich by doing an ICO. I don't know crap about anything, please, someone do everything for me, for free or close to it." <SEP> @phalexo  I took note of Vitalik's vision of having blockchains/smart contracts implemented on many other things (not just ICOs crowdfunding). And, we are just among those who embrace Vitalik's vision. So, I guess out of that 99.999%, we are part of that 0.111%. LOL... :laughing: <SEP> @AliceTheHive Sure, but your math is off a bit. :-) <SEP> @phalexo It's ok, the `off` part is fully-funded.! Our economic-models remains positive. :P <SEP> @AliceTheHive Do you know if Ethers granted to miners are minted or taken from some foundation reserve account? <SEP> @phalexo Emmm... Never occurs to me to think that - probably, a combination of both ... or lost ETH in-the-wild? <SEP> No one has control over "lost ether" so that cannot be the source. <SEP> Minted Ethers are still logical... that would keep the `blocks` in the chains in-sync... <SEP> If Ether is minted then it is a source of inflation and is keeping Ether value down. <SEP> Taking about syncing... this article is for newbies/users who are having `sync difficulties`. Well... just an info sharing  - sharing is caring :love_letter:  :kiss: :kissing_heart:  Read and try at your own perils... https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/02/14/geth-1-8-iceberg%C2%B9/ <SEP> @phalexo At some point, that would be good for real application of Vitalik's vision of blockchains.  Demand versus supply - there'll be perspectives of +/- if that happens. The `high-value` which happens now is a hype that gets to people for certain purposes/intent/opportunities. <SEP> I don't know what his vision is, but I have been thinking about applications to cyber security, tracking drug components, and such... <SEP> Hype has its utility. How do you convince a lot of sheep that something is good and they should try it? Hype. <SEP> Guys, I was wondering if some ICOs accept payments through credit card directly? And if not, why so? <SEP> @phalexo  Vitalik's did tweeted `in sarcasm` of how blockchains are used `more` towards ICOs, crowdfunding, etc... Your thoughts about other applications of blockchains seems to be supportive of  his visions. And, you are not alone. I guess you and I are that `part ' of 0.111%. LOL... :laughing: <SEP> I'm counting sheeps when I have difficuilties to sleep ... :laughing: <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter Most banks do not want that business. Fraud prone. <SEP> @AliceTheHive Learn to blank your mind. I must admit it is not easy sometimes. My trick is to mentally hum every time I sense a forming thought. <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter there are ICOs accepting credit-cards. But, be aware, do at your own perils... :crying_cat_face: <SEP> @phalexo My mind keeps working when I sleep (or in hybernation-mode). That's the perils being a technology-enabler... :cry: <SEP> @phalexo @AliceTheHive But the banks won't know tho? I mean if I allow my investors to transfer USD into my bank account and I tranfer MyToken into their ether wallet, how will the bank know? <SEP> @AliceTheHive Do you happen to know any? <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter That depends on to what extend those banks `will` undertake their corporate governance processes and policies involves. If their policies is driven by their country central banks policies, those banks may scrutinize transactions. <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter I `dare not` to state (or even recommends) any. <SEP> Aha I understand <SEP> Thanks! <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter There are KYC policies tho - as part of governance; by banks, central banks... to ensure some controls on fintech... <SEP> @AliceTheHive Yes true, if they find out sh*t would get serious lol. So what ICOs usually do is transfer the investments they got(ETH or BTC or any alt coin) into USD through exchange websites or am I mistaken? <SEP> @RiadRifai_twitter They are many popular methods/principles - either `technically right vs morally wrong`, `technically wrong vs morally right`, `technically right vs morally right`, `technically wrong vs morally wrong`, etc. LOL... :smile: <SEP> The iterations are endless... :laughing: <SEP> Lolll, such an adventurous field to work in <SEP> True, and the adventures can be interesting...but one shall learn a lot... :smile: <SEP> how can we help you if we don't know all details

<SEP> Oh, so it's the same but different UI? Is it worthy to have both installed? At Mist also smart contracts, token, can be deployed? Thx! @3esmit <SEP> If you are using coinbase.com u might expect delays, and if happens to don't ever send it, you should open an issue with them. <SEP> @xibot Depends in your needs, you might find Ethereum Wallet better if you are not interested in navigating through dapps, if you want to explore dapps you should use Mist. <SEP> Awesome, so using Mist I can "browse" for Dapps? Sounds great @3esmit! Thx a lot! :)

<SEP> 3 <SEP> i have a question about account creation and unlocking <SEP> it seems impossible via the json api <SEP> Either https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum or https://gitter.im/ethereum/web3.js <SEP> I can help you with that actually. Come to web3 <SEP> ok <SEP> Someone knows a website where I can see how I can handle my transaction automatically. I want to run my own C++ code (if it's possible) Thanks <SEP> Hi, has more and mote people should be able to create contracts, do you think a visual editor would be nice to have ? I thinh of something like google/blockly. <SEP> @NicolasMassart http://etherscripter.com/0-5-1/ works, but only with Serpent and LLL, and it's not really supported or up to date <SEP> Nice, thank you ! <SEP> I hope it will be updated and one day included in some sort of wallet app to publish some contract. <SEP> I wouldn't hold your breath, it hasn't been updated in a really long time <SEP> Hey @Repere56! I am not aware of such a site, if you mean "Can you run my smart contract for me without me having to set up a node?", because they would just get leeched to death.    Perhaps there is such a site, though?    You can use browser-solidity to try things out.    Also, "run my C++" code is a little confusing to me.    Because you cannot write smart contracts in C++. <SEP> @NicolasMassart Have you looked at the Mix IDE?
<SEP> hello <SEP> @AliceTheHive yes, i did see this in etherscan - i also get a warning that the gas cannot be estimated when i tried to submit this and other contracts. Still not sure how to fix, maybe stop using mist and use an alternate method of accessing the blockchain? <SEP> I've found that the easies way to generate a bitcon address is to use nodejs as follows https://i.imgur.com/NnWjYCF.png   This can be done without installing nothing but nodejs library.  What is the easiest way for ethereum to do the same ? <SEP> @skyrred I'll share two function() in account `interactions`; typically used but `varies` in `usage-env` or `context `:  `web3.eth.accounts` * Definition : Package to `generate` Ethereum accounts and `sign` transactions & data. * `performed` on local node; desktop wallets (ex: Mist, Ethereum Wallet) uses this to create accounts , save private keys , signing transactions, etc. locally; * since operations are performed locally, the `private keys` will not be sent to other node on the network; they are safe. * reasons why desktop wallets (ex : Mist, Ethereum Wallet) sync the entire block chain onto your local system; don't require login until you log-out (as infos of your accounts is stored temporarily until/unless entire data is cleared from the app folder).  `web3.eth.personal` * Definition : Package that allows you to `interact` with the Ethereum `nodes accounts`. * is used if you want to interact with another nodes accounts; which means whatever `passwords` you send will be used by some other node altogether; * is `not used` to create user accounts or store the private keys; it will be used `only` to use the intended `nodes`. <SEP> @zarkinfrood_twitter The `more knowledge` you learn, the `merrier` it is. :smile: <SEP> Hi guys after how many confirmations does a transaction (asset) reach etherdelta? <SEP> @youxiaowei ?`MyEtherWallet`?

I am looking for someone that can help me with creating a token that I want to use to crowdfund a property development in South Africa. <SEP> The idea is to generate the funds to develop a property, then sell the property.  Part of the profits plus the initial investment will then be distributed back to the token buyers.  If you know of anyone that will be able to assist, please get in touch with me on johnny.alford@gmail.com <SEP> I am using ganache-cli....and it is providing me 10 test accounts with 100ETH balance. when i close that cmd and start ganache-cli it creates new 10 test accounts everytime.. so how to retrieve my old account bcoz i have used that account reference in whole application ? <SEP> @bhavinsharda Give this a shot ; ``` ganache-cli --deterministic ``` :information_source: `Try` to generate the same addresses (if applicable).  ``` ganache-cli --deterministic --db  <SEP> @galkaknoll If you have the info (address, pass, key), you should be able to access.

In general, few possibilities are; * Your tx goes but it could be `pending` * You are `out-of-gas` * Your account `compromised` * Your tx was `processed` by some miners  Read similar issues on `negative` balance (if you use Metamask and recommended steps): MetaMask : https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/2270  Note : Check your tx status; ex : `Cancelled`, etc ?  :information_source: *In a "Cancelled" transaction, your Ether value is not deducted from your sending account.

Emmm...just use what's EZ/best for your purpose... <SEP> i`m new t`this stuff. Looking at Harware Wallets as "most secure", your thoughts? <SEP> @Kemosabe342_twitter `Without Prejudice`; * Things `can or can't` be secure - as to how one engage precautions to ensure being secure. * Prying `eyes` are always on-the-look-out for exploits. * Hardware `security patches` await-time could cause owners to be vulnerable. * What `crypto-currencies` are supported by those devices. * Make sure your purchase of hardware wallets does not c/w compromised `seeds` default voucher or tempered packaging. * Check-out the net - see latest vulnerability issues and updates. <SEP> @Kemosabe342_twitter Review is good!

<SEP> Hi Looking for a developer who can create an asset based cryptocurrency on Ethereum <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Mind explaining? <SEP> Well forgive the ignorance: A client is looking to set up a cryptocurrency which is backed by physical tradeable assets such as Platinum and Ethanol... <SEP> eg 1 Token will be equal to 1 gram of platinum metal. <SEP> How does ETH work? <SEP> I'm new to the whole digital currency scene. I currently don't own any BTC or ETH. <SEP> @kayabaNerve Tks!! <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You would have to set the price manually or offer an exchange <SEP> You can't do it solely on the chain <SEP> @thatonetrick_twitter It's a cryptocurrency. Your wallet is a set of data used to sign transactions (say that it was you). <SEP> Your balance is a number on a dataset contained by thousands os different computers that verify each other. <SEP> The the price would be set against the price of the physical asset trading on the global markets. eg. If the price of  platinum is $35per gram then the token will be trading at $35 and have its price change according to the platimum held. There will be physical platimum held in storage. <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter So what needs to be done is a generic ERC20 <SEP> Then you need a central exchange to fix the price <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter You'd have to rely on an outside service to feed platinum prices into the contract all the time. Will you be making a market to keep the prices linked? <SEP> @phalexo The coin doesn't need the price. The exchange does. <SEP> And the number doesn't matter if it has no backing. <SEP> So they need an exchange and a standard ERC20 with whatever constructor they choose. (I mean, doesn't have to be ERC20 but...) <SEP> @kayabaNerve Maybe  I am wrong but I think he wants to accept fiat currencies in exchange for platinum. These coins would essentially be depository receipts. <SEP> The coin itself can be linked to a gram of platinum of particular purity, this does not need to change, but allowing people to buy with USD, EURO is more involved. <SEP> Thanks yes. More or less. There is going to be reliance on an official price feed which will then automatcally translate in value to the coin <SEP> Yeah but that's exchange level <SEP> How do you mean? Because we are saying buy 1 token equal to 1 gram which is stored in Vault X. The token moves according to the price of the platinum traded on the global markets <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Are you fixing the coin price to platinum or something else? <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter To enforce that, you need to have an exchange that sets the price and buy/sells for that amount. <SEP> Else, the market will decide the value. <SEP> Even if the coin stores a number labelled value, that doesn't make it worth that. <SEP> To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams or have a exchange for the fiat (or crypto) equivalent per coin <SEP> If a coin could say and enforce a value, I would make one for 100 USD rn and sell them all <SEP> You can have the exchange in the coin but then you're stuck with a ETH/ERC20 value map <SEP> Ok so if I am hearing you right. We need to create an exchange for the cryptocurrency Buy/Sell <SEP> Is that right? <SEP> Yes <SEP> You need to buy and sell the coin for that value <SEP> If you only sell it, then you can't use it. It's worthless <SEP> Only buy? It doesnt get distribution <SEP> Let's say they take a deposit of 1 gram of Pt from a citizen, and issue 1 token to signify that any time this citizen wants a gram of Pt back all he has to do is send in his 1 coin. There is no need for making the market. The coin is pegged to the value of platinum. <SEP> You only need to make a market if you want rates to float. <SEP> And that counts as an exchange <SEP> "To make it worth that, you either have to buy sell for actual grams" <SEP> No idea how the group makes money though <SEP> They're the only exchange in this idea. They can't sell to themselves <SEP> Some fees for storage. <SEP> I guess. Why not just keep the Platinum then? <SEP> Providing security. <SEP> Ok can it be done? If so how long would it take to launch? <SEP> Commodity exchanges are regulated,, you need to consult with attorneys if you can legally do this and if you need to register your exchange. <SEP> And then there's the issue if something does happen to the platinum <SEP> Everyone would sue you for the money <SEP> You need to talk to people about accepting Fiat if you do that <SEP> If you just take Eth, you can get the exchange software up in a few days <SEP> You said this was a client of yours? May I ask what your job is?

I use, I thought,  an average amount of gas. The transaction hasn't appeared on the chain, though the amount of ether hasn't been subtracted from my balance either and in my wallet I see that the transaction itself is now no longer pending, though it was for a couple of hours. Has this transaction been rejected? Did I use too little gas? Is that amount of ether still 'reserved' and waiting for processing or has that transaction been cancelled? I know this is probably an irritating question for the more advanced among you but i'd appreciate some help! <SEP> @WanderingConsciousness i got same question
<SEP> hey guys, I had some noob questions regarding smart-contracts <SEP> how do smart-contracts actually run? <SEP> what do you mean? <SEP> they are run by miners on the network that process the transactions and the programs that are called in that block <SEP> as in, how does somebody call a smart-contract? <SEP> you can call a smart contract using one of the many ethereum clients, the easiest being the ethereum wallet <SEP> which is a GUI ether wallet with the ethereum client built in <SEP> it also has a GUI interface for sending ether, and triggering contracts <SEP> so when I call a contract, the call is broadcasted and when it reaches a miner, the miner then runs the smart-contract? <SEP> yep basically <SEP> also, how does a smart-contract store something on the blockchain? <SEP> as in, does it broadcast a request and when the next block is made by a miner, the data gets included in the block? <SEP> hmm, the actually blockchain mechanics im not entirely sure <SEP> but there certainly is a way for smart-contracts to put data on the blockchain, right? <SEP> a contract can only store what it already has defined in memory, and it cant be changed or manipulated once deployed <SEP> so it can store its own data and it can keep updating that data when you call it <SEP> also, from a financial perspective, is it better to run an entire program that doesn't need such massive decentralization as smart-contracts(gas costs are expensive, I heard)? <SEP> Gas is a cost to make up what the dev spends over and above the presale money <SEP> um sorry, I was under the impression that each operation of a smart-contract costs some amount of money, known as "gas" <SEP> is that not the case? <SEP> Can anyone change the notepad made by microsoft in the year 1994 <SEP> no? <SEP> as in, they can certainly change and release it in a later year, but not in 1994 <SEP> or was that not directed at me? <SEP> @goluhaque Im still new, so im not sure what is better or not, but from what i understand, every time you make a transaction it costs gas, as it re-runs your contracts again with the new data, ether you give it etc... <SEP> The main theme is Security in Ethereum, and a smart guy need not make a contract to save money, he can do it in simple logostic ways <SEP> the more modular you make your code for instance, the more gas intensive it will be <SEP> BRB i am burning some gas to cook my Chicken with the same spices and try to make it more tastier .. LOL <SEP> @xtac4u22 RE:  32-bit.   See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4b5l96/quick_breakdown_of_operating_systems_which_people/ for information on our current OS distribution.    There are a number of people asking for 32-bit support, but we have lots of work on our plate and we only have limited resources.    Most people using Ethereum right now **do** have 64-bit machines.    If individuals in the community want 32-bit support then we need them to step up and help.    Speaking for myself, outside of my work for the Foundation I am also doing work to bring Ethereum to mobile and wearable Linux, and all kinds of "resource constrained devices".   See http://doublethink.co.    All of my targets are 32-bit ARM.    If you can roll up your sleeves and build from source, this stuff is not impossible.   But it isn't trivial either.    Adding 32-bit support would mean doubling our build machine count.   It would cost real time and money to do.    So I'm sure we will get there.   It just isn't an immediate priority, because it only affects a subset of users.    We have numerous things which affect all existing users, and those have to have a priority.  As I think I've suggested before on this channel, perhaps somebody (you?) could try to get together a group of interested parties, either on Reddit, or maybe on the Ethereum Champions Slack, and put out a bounty for somebody to build and release 32-bit Windows binaries?     It doesn't **have** to be the Foundation doing the work. <SEP> another doubt guys: can a smart-contract pay ETH from a wallet to another users' wallet? <SEP> wouldn't that require the smart-contract to contain private key of the payer wallet(the wallet FROM which it pays), which can be seen by people who decompile the compiled smart-contract

<SEP> hi <SEP> I definitely didn't get phished and the only place I've put my seed words is Indira. If you look at the wallet my ether got sent to there are similar transactions whereby they instantly go to that wallet after getting transferred in somewhere else <SEP> Infura* <SEP> Has anyone seen something like this before and is my ether just lost now <SEP> @reubik You meant bought on CB and sent to Metamask? <SEP> Why did you put your seed words on Infura? Sounds like you got phished <SEP> It's a bot where people scan compromised addresses for ETH and send when it comes in <SEP> Yeah that's what I mean. So how did I get phished? I didn't have to confirm any transactions on metamask <SEP> Your seed words are full wallet access <SEP> And I thought you needed to connect metamask to infura to generate an API key? <SEP> That's different from giving your seed words? <SEP> Seed words = private key. Metamask UI's just controls how the private key is accessed; it can't control how the private key is used outside of Metamask itself. <SEP> Also, I have no idea if the legit Infura requires some Metamask connection. You dont need to connect to Infura to use Metamask though... <SEP> Yeah I was tryna deploy a contract I wrote <SEP> Oh my bad I only had the key in my truffle.js <SEP> I didn't actually type it into infura but it must have got intercepted somehow I'm so confused <SEP> It can't get intercepted... <SEP> 1) Did you verify you actually sent it to your address? 2) How did you get Metamask? <SEP> Yeah it did get sent to my address, check the etherscan link. That's the address on metamask. I just got it through downloading the chrome extension <SEP> I can take any Etherscan link and claim it's my address. I'm asking if you've verified it's the one in Metamask. That's it. <SEP> Oh ok sorry! Yeah it is <SEP> You got compromised at some point. That's all I can say :/ <SEP> Sorry it happened to you <SEP> Ahh sucks man. Cheers for your help anyway. Ill just have to be more careful next time but I really don't know how this happened <SEP> If it was a different address (even the same start/end but different middle), I'd say you'd have a virus which scans for addresses on the clip board and replaces them. <SEP> I'd delete that extension and use MEW in the future (if you decide to try again) <SEP> Also send a small amount first to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again <SEP> Ok yeah <SEP> I'm kinda tied to the extension just cause of how I'm trying to use the ether but I guess what I can do is just make a new account, virus scan etc and store most of the ether in a MEW account <SEP> Thanks again for your help man <SEP> i have a question how to set my token logo in ethereum? <SEP> You can't; just on services around Ethereum <SEP> Hi. I am running a blockchain miner on azure and it is minings ethers. Are those real  ethers or just test ethers ? <SEP> @sahni619 That's not enough info; likely not mainnet ether if you make your money back. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  didn't get you ? So I am using a trial azure account and I have setup ethereum blockchain consortium on it and it has been mining.. I am able to use those when I add new rpc in metamask but if these are real ethers I should be able to use on main network as well.. Isn't? I am new to this so getting things to understand <SEP> How many have you mined? How much have you paid Azure? <SEP> You are correct that if they're mainnet Ether, you can use them on the mainnet. <SEP> till now those were  free credits of around 300 dollars <SEP> now I am left with 150 dollars free credit <SEP> nodes are still mining <SEP> How much ETH have you mined? <SEP> Over what time period is this? :P <SEP> If the answer is a few days and 0.1 ETH, it could be the mainnet <SEP> hehe.. So the answer is few days and a lot of ethers.. probably not main net <SEP> Yep <SEP> alrite thanks for clarifying :) <SEP> It's probably Ropsten. <SEP> appreciate your assistance <SEP> Or a private network <SEP> How will u get .1 ether unless u are not mining in pool <SEP> yes @bit-warrior  I got you now :D <SEP> it must be a private network then <SEP> but theres one more catch here.. I am able to create a smart contract using metamask and poa network and I  am able to  create ERC-20 token with all  those ethers.. <SEP> If you're mining, it isn't PoA <SEP> aah  ok..  So I will be able to do a crowdsale with these ethers using poa network wizard using there gui because I am able to do that <SEP> It's PoA, you're not mining. <SEP> PoA gets rid of mining. <SEP> And why would anyone buy Ethers on your centralized network?

<SEP> Ok I understand <SEP> I think the big issue with the price though is the transfer of platinum <SEP> Not necessarily the coin part <SEP> @phalexo He can become a Sovereign Citizen! They only have to follow the laws they agree to! <SEP> @kayabaNerve is really trolling right now yet that is a legit concept some people actually believe in. RIP this word. <SEP> As highlighted there is a big institutional partner who will be holding the platinum in vault. And they have all the regulations. <SEP> I am sure claiming sovereignty worked out well for all the federal prisoners. <SEP> They already sell to the public and hold the assets in storage <SEP> @phalexo Duh of course. They're Sovereign Citizens. They only have to follow the laws they choose to follow! <SEP> Since access to coins is global you have to contend with different jurisdictions. <SEP> So our thinking was that having them as partners would make the difference in terms of exchange and so on. <SEP> @NicoNicomush_twitter Then sounds like it wouldn't be an issue. I would be careful though. You sound like a 'reseller' <SEP> And a reseller is still a seller <SEP> Ok I hear what you mean? <SEP> The vision was that there would be an issue of say 100,000 tokens equal to 100,000 grams of platinum. The platinum would be available in exchange for the token should one desire it or for fiat.

<SEP> @exlemor  i take your advice..If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather tell them to long for the endless immensity of the sea. <SEP> @kayabaNerve We have an exchange medium- rimule(ERC 20). Which will be used for exchange of goods and services in rimulation. We say there is away to simulate your projects with real time material flow. We have a blockchain implementation for v-tube ( we use hyper ledger), We use EVM - for rimule creation protocol and we have more Self evolving algorithms to build rimulation.

This is not the Mist client right ? <SEP> This isn't your channel <SEP> No one here has been asking <SEP> You don't have a large following here <SEP> @Kaizenathon we use this chat because we use EVM for rimule creation protocol and planning to raise our seed fund through smart contract. <SEP> @VinothRajaJ_twitter don't advertise here though <SEP> Lol <SEP> Anyways <SEP> What goods are you even talking about? <SEP> Oh.

You can modify it to suit your needs <SEP> Can you use other program languages with a DAO ? <SEP> Thanks Bobsummerwill  that clears things up a little <SEP> Pretty much all Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, @coryclark1. <SEP> @theinvestmentguy Nobody really mines on Mac, because the GPU isn't powerful enough.    Try installing `ethminer` using Homebrew (http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/installing-binaries/osx-homebrew.html), and then running `ethminer -G -M` and seeing whether or not it likes your card. <SEP> Hey @novenabye, - http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/mining.html <SEP> @bobsummerwill that DAO link was interesting <SEP> Yes, @gimegoch. <SEP> can a contract use different programming languages ? <SEP> I am not every technical <SEP> @coryclark1 There are only three languages that can currently be used: Solidity (JS-like), Serpent(python-like), and LLL(Lisp-like) <SEP> Most people use Solidity, and it is by far the best supported and most familiar/easy to learn <SEP> Thanks tjade273 that clears some things up.

<SEP> @Berith_co_twitter Hello  this is Berithcoin in Korea, we currently opened the ICO and we are planning to open the service next year.  Coud we ask some questions? We planned that our service and coins would be spent in transactions in our real life and the coins would be issued as ERC20 However we have two problems!!  The first one is that small amount of transaction also incur much gas price. So it is not advantageous for gas  to be spent for the small amount transaction. Is there a way we can spend less on gas price for the small amount transaction? The second problem is that the system would be much slower if many people start to use the service. Is there a way we can maintain the speed of the service in block chain? We want to listen your ideas and solutions . Thank you. <SEP> Hello,how can I create many wallets of ETH for customers of business center automatically? <SEP> yes,a single wallet,how do I create a single wallet? <SEP> either way, it seems like something you would work into the registration workflow...whatever that is <SEP> and you hold all the eth? <SEP> you create Ethereum addresses by creating a private key first <SEP> you need that key to do anything with the address
<SEP> Hey all <SEP> So what kind of applications are possible to build with Ethereum? <SEP> @InsidiousMind The limit is your imagination <SEP> But usually we tend to build things to be trustless, autonomous and descentralized. <SEP> hm I'm imagining a decentralized application where users can connect, chat, and search. This is my first time really building anything to do with the blockchain, however, apart from some dabbling in Bitcoin (but that's not really 'building'). I'm looking for some pointers on where to get started, and if the basic idea of my app is even possible to do with something like Ethereum. I'm downloading the command line tools/C++ toolkit now <SEP> @3esmit that's awesome! Exactly what I was looking for. Even using a similar stack (React/Redux)

<SEP> How can I start a project for ethereum uses in the food industry? <SEP> @dannygkass Real world use cases are a ways off, but I'm interested in what you have in mind. <SEP> Possibly creating a system where you use the timestamp feature to track the freshness of all the raw ingredients  along the food chain so that a customers at a restaurants that uses this systems can show it customers the data of all its ingredients and etc. This could help customers make batter choices on what to eat and help restaurants gain more trust among it customers which equals more business.

<SEP> hi <SEP> how can delete a smart contract? <SEP> @Sinergia_B_twitter You can't once it is deployed, you can disable it by calling the suicide function if it had one though. <SEP> I need help , please i sent 38 GRX with 54510 Gas and 30 GWEI and on my Myetherwallet there was 0.005 ETH , i saw in etherscan.io the transaction still in a block for waiting <SEP> what means it? <SEP> Hey guys <SEP> can someone help me craft a manual contract creation transaction <SEP> so i can manually set the nonce <SEP> How can I get some ether into my test network account? <SEP> Ho sell ether?

<SEP> Hi. Where can I manage ethereum wallet online? <SEP> @mastfreaky Metamask is a chrome extension that manages your ether accounts.

<SEP> hi there <SEP> @phalexo  thanks <SEP> I install a smart contract and I send some ECR20 tockens to it .. is there any function called in the receiving smart contract ? <SEP> Not with an erc20 <SEP> If you want to track incoming erc20, call approve and have the contract call transferfrom <SEP> I need a block chain dev that is located in the Dallas area. We are preparing for a Token offering in February 2019.  Surely there is someone in Dallas with these skill sets  :) Please contact me direct.    iNeedICOdev@gmail.com <SEP> Don't fall for scams. NEVER GIVE YOUR PRIVATE KEY/WALLET FILE TO ANYONE. Anyone offering support over private/direct messages, email, or something other than here is likely a scammer. <SEP> @davidstanton001_twitter You still online? <SEP> Rather not move to email yet but would be interested in PMing you <SEP> yes I am here <SEP> @kayabaNerve  yes  I am here.   sorry bout that <SEP> @davidstanton001_twitter I'll PM you. Sorry for my delay. Coding something... <SEP> @kayabaNerve  no hurry  I am here. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  really ? No notification is called to the receiver when ECR20 token are send to him ? <SEP> Not a contract <SEP> An erc20 isn't something in the Ethereum protocol. It's a self contained contract. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  so it's up to the implementation of the ECR20 interface if it will call something or nothing <SEP> Saying an erc20 send should notify the recepient contract is like saying all contracts should notify all contracts. <SEP> isn't it ? <SEP> To work between contracts, you should use approve and transferfrom <SEP> @kayabaNerve  I don't get it <SEP> *work with an erc20 between contracts. If you only need to know your balance, not verify who sent it, balance and transfer are good enough <SEP> Contracts don't contact each other like that. If you deploy a contract dependent on an erc20, the contract must call the erc20 itself. <SEP> If you need just to know if the contract can spend money, balance and transfer are all you need <SEP> If you need to verify who sent the erc20, as a contract can't pull up the chain history, use approve and transferfrom <SEP> @kayabaNerve  what I am trying to achieve is that : someone send ECT20 to a contract and the contract approve all the amount so the the same user can withdraw them <SEP> No idea why but ok. You want the user to approve it, the contract to call transferfrom, and then the contract can either call approve and the user can call transferfrom, or the user can call withdraw and the contract can call transfer. <SEP> The big picture is to  move ECR20 tockens to another blockchain. So I need a contract that let the ECR20 owner to deposit and withdraw the tockens till a deadline. After the deadline all the tocken owned by the contract will be sent to a null address. <SEP> than I need a snapshot of who and the amount of the ECR20 in the contract to replicate the same distribution in the new blockchain <SEP> @kayabaNerve so the only way to archive it is not to the ECR20 owner to send to the contract, but the contract to transferFrom the ECR20 owner <SEP> ? <SEP> That's just an if statement; you should tie it to the block number over the time though. <SEP> Snapshot is easy. You don't even need a second contract for this. <SEP> 1) just snapshot and freeze the erc20. <SEP> 2) just snapshot the erc20 and tell people they're now worthless. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  ECR20 interface has not a freeze <SEP> 3) have people burn the tokens. <SEP> That doesn't mean your contract can't have one if it isn't already deployed. <SEP> And yes about the transferfrom <SEP> @kayabaNerve  it's already deploied <SEP> Then transferfrom/burn <SEP> @kayabaNerve  I am trying to let the user withdraw the tockens till the deadline. Imagine if the deadline is in 6 mouths and in 3 mounth tocken price is at 100x. <SEP> Maybe the user wants to sell them: so I need to burn the tocken at deadline .. not before <SEP> but it's not a must <SEP> So you can make a contract before hand that acts as a vault and stops access after X time; heck, I could make you one; or you can have users burn the tokens after the fact <SEP> and I need another smart contract cause I need the user to register the public key of the account in the new blockchain <SEP> to know where to sent the tockens to <SEP> I'd recommend making that the same over <SEP> Why make two contacts to lock come and <SEP> *lock coins and sign up when you can just have one overall for the new chain?

SMy E-mail: leaderams2017@gmail.com <SEP> Thanks so much <SEP> @cybrominions Ethereum discourage pool mining by giving partial rewards to abandonned mined blocks. With block traffic really fast, you would find yourself more profit mining alone rather than in a pool <SEP> I have a general question and Im not sure this is the right place, but I'll go a head anyway: I have been reading with great interest the collaboration between russian goverment to issue their own digital currency thats tied to the national currency. Why is not this already the case for the major currencies (like dollar and euro) if the blockchain is secure and scalable enough? And is the general assumption of people  that this is only a matter of when not if, or? I would advocate that if/when blockchain-Euro or blockchain-dollar gets introduced Etherum and Bitcoin value will plummet. Also, are there a lot of people trying to build blockchain 2.0, like an improved version or is the blockchain technology "perfect"? (Bare in mind that I am a economist not a programmer, so I have limited technical understanding) <SEP> @whiteshark05 You don't know what you are talking about. Go ahead, mine solo for a while, you'll never see a single wei. <SEP> @NorwegianWonderer  there are different proposals from central banks to issue Digital Base money on a blockchain. e.g. Countries like Singapore are thinking about it.

Problem is I can't remember what wallet I used in the beginning.  I was mining to it a year ago.  It does show a balance in my v9.3 ethereum wallet however.  I installed it a week ago.  The balance showing has etherbase next to address.  So I guess I going to have to take a trip down memory lane. <SEP> @DalefJr_twitter i am absolutely sure, that you can remember the day even the second, where you created the account- there is also the way of phrase in case of other software e.g. parity  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mnemonic_phrase  as you are older like i am, try to fetch some other papers, letters from that week last year, prepare a tea, relax and start to read the other old material- the age of that account is given within the account name (UTC--datecode---etc) <SEP> why ehtereum wallet is very bad on windows <SEP> every reboot i have to delete all the chaindata folder and reneable fast sync to make it work <SEP> second i have made 2 transfers 1 was received and the other not yet <SEP> how to cancel the transaction <SEP> and both transaction show 9 confirmation in my wallet <SEP> need some advice or help about these issue <SEP> sorry both shows 0 confirmation not 9 <SEP> 0 <SEP> how to contact ethereum support ? <SEP> @roninkaizen Thanks again!
<SEP> hello colleagues <SEP> need your advice <SEP> Please tell me the application of the blockchain system for the trading platform <SEP> Hi All,
<SEP> hello <SEP> Could someone give me a hint.. I installed cpp version of ethereum (1.2.2), I started eth it's syncing with the network as far as I can see... but how do I access the node? I understand there is json rpc. Does eth itself has no console? <SEP> Does AlethOne give an indication if you get a block reward? <SEP> @ivica7 use `eth attach` from another terminal, or start it using `eth console` <SEP> @tjade273 thanks a lot... I was able to connect via web3.js, going to try with eth attach <SEP> hi can someone help me how to start mine with Aleth zero ? <SEP> and how do i know it is mining sorry i am new <SEP> Its like talking into a void.  Come on Ethereum lets do a little work on cummunity support.  So much lacking here!  Could be soooo much more. <SEP> Lots of internal chatter, groupies with insider information, the process needs to be way more open, and open to criticism...even at a management level.  Just sayin. <SEP> does someone know how to start mine with aleth zero ?? <SEP> and how do i know the mining process is working ? <SEP> and what mining process looks like ? <SEP> @boondogger you can ask here or at github.com/Ethereum/mist/issues <SEP> What's your issue? <SEP> @aliensyntax what OS are you using? <SEP> @boondogger if you ask a concerete question, someone will answer, or direct you to the right place <SEP> Thank You <SEP> I don't know anything about Aleth One, but you can use the command line miner with Supernova <SEP> https://eth.suprnova.cc/index.php?page=gettingstarted <SEP> @tjade273 <SEP> thx <SEP> @tjade273  working <SEP> Hey @Abitserious, For mining setup, your best venue is https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining. The sidebar there has guides and pool information. <SEP> Ethereum node synchronization stopped half-way, I closed the window and resumed it, and it lost the progress and started downloading from the start again. Do I have to make sure the downloading process must finish at one go without interruption? <SEP> not sure where to ask a mining question but here it goes: <SEP> i know it says no binaries for osx 10.11 yet <SEP> Multiplier your ethereum using smart contract http://double-ethe.rhcloud.com <SEP> but tried something i read at https://ethereum-homestead.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-ecosystem/community.html#gitter-rooms <SEP> it says Please reinstall homebrew/versions/llvm37. Sorry :( <SEP> is this the same thing? <SEP> Hey @sjaith, We need more information on what exactly you have done.    It sounds like you are trying to install or build the C++ client for OS X El Capitan?    Please could you confirm?  If so, you need to follow one of these sets of steps: http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/installing-binaries/osx-homebrew.html http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/building-from-source/osx.html  If you can't get it working, please head over to https://gitter.im/ethereum/cpp-ethereum and we should be able to help to get you moving.

So (50/94,243,175)% of the PoS blocks <SEP> You'd want at least 0.023% of all Ether <SEP> 21675 Ether... <SEP> For pos account, what minimum qty. Of ether i should have? <SEP> Also, I'm not a PoS expert. This is the theory of PoS. Not Ethereum's implementation. <SEP> 21675 <SEP> So if someone is having 21675 ether, then he can be the validator for pos?? <SEP> Theoretically he could do 1 block a day? But the rewards are going down. <SEP> Okay..and any idea when pos will be activated? <SEP> Next month is the estimate <SEP> Can you get 7 million USD of Ether by then? <SEP> Thanks a lot man... And any price predictipns for eth? <SEP> 400 USD by end of next month is my personal <SEP> No i cant get. Actually i m thinkng for mining .

<SEP> @pretext How is that different from someone sending you a political e-mail or a pamphlet? <SEP> @pretext if you burn them, that's also visible on the public ledger, though <SEP> We will aim to issue every police person a blockchain. <SEP> it does sound like the "political e-mail or pamphlet" analogy though <SEP> who is actually going to blame people for "owning" something that was sent to them through a channel into which anyone can dump anything for no reason without the "owner"'s consent?
<SEP> I did a withdrawal from an exchange to another one. I got the confirmation with an tx id. But etherscan does not find anything with the tx id. this was 5 hours ago. Is there anything I can do? <SEP> It is beginning to sound more and more every day that if you ever send from an exchange then you should send to your own wallet first <SEP> why? <SEP> 00-1e-52-cd-a8-e3 ... i wish someone would contact me to resolve some major issues ... ethereum was boosted with most of my bitcoin from core 1,2 and 3 .. 2008 nothing was being mined. i had to buy the first and second sha and also traded in i,G and forex before 2009 . i am the victim of maybe the biggest ever scam and fraud and i feel like nothing is being done to assist me here .. im no pro  developer but maybe just luck at the rite time back then .. this is huge serious effect global im sure. <SEP> this might happen if I sent to my personal wallet, too. The tx is not getting into a block. <SEP> But then you would only need to open one support ticket with one exchange

I'm a long time follower of Ethereum but just downloaded the Ethereum wallet to start playing around. Could someone please send me some Test-Net Ether? It would be much appreciated. Please do not send actual ether, Test-Net only. 0x6Ab1b1175F9D8A3cCa7d39a28F61314ac8D11C3F <SEP> @cwhinfrey you know you can mine by yourself and can get either in 30 min? <SEP> @makoto I have been mining on the Test-Net for a few hours now (on a MacBook Pro) but still don't have a single Finney. Am I likely doing something wrong? <SEP> @cwhinfrey I didn't have much success w/ cpu mining on testnet on an old 2010 MBP. You might switch to gpu based mining (was able to quickly get test ether using gpus on a nMP) <SEP> @ngwese Good to hear it's not just me having trouble cpu mining on the Test-Net. Are you using the C++ implementation of Ethereum to do GPU mining or something else? <SEP> @cwhinfrey i'm using geth-1.5.0-unstable (built from source) to get much better syncing performance and then just ethminer -G from cpp-ethereum (installed via brew https://github.com/ethereum/homebrew-ethereum) <SEP> I am trying to work with ethereum with test network. When i copy my wallet id it is like hex number and i can't get any amount of coins there <SEP> When i press "Get Free Ether" and type my wallet id it shows me that my wallet id is wrong

<SEP> hello <SEP> someoen can help me regarding ethereum <SEP> have some questions <SEP> @KingScorpio you can start learning about solidity and Ethereum dapp building here : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb3Rrg2t4PZ59Sna497DUZA?sub_confirmation=1 <SEP> i want to know about the new changes on the plattform how are transactions now feed? <SEP> boa damn this chat is so dead whats with ethereum is it dead now? <SEP> @KingScorpio This chat is slow; Ethereum isn't dead. <SEP> The #2 rating on CMC proves that. <SEP> #2 is only because index mafia refuses to list coins with higher marketcap <SEP> LOL. There isn't a coin with a higher market cap than Ethereum (besides BTC). <SEP> Feel free to prove me wrong. <SEP> thats not true anyone can create a "coin" with a higher marketcap <SEP> ... what. <SEP> marketcap = price X total available supply <SEP> Marketcap is a mix of coin supply and price <SEP> not a mix its a product a multiplication you milkdrinker... <SEP> ... <SEP> You just want to insult people or do you want ask questions? <SEP> the index mafia prevents listening of coins that have a huge supply but a huge price in order to protect the bitcoin centristic world <SEP> i am telling you how the index mafia works <SEP>  whats an index mafia <SEP> I know how CMC works. You're forgetting something though <SEP> @annonch CMC <SEP> ohm jes and CMC is same scam <SEP> as i said higher marketcap is easy, its just prize times supply <SEP> I can create an ERC20 with 5 trillion coins and sell one to a friend for a dollar. That doesn't mean my coin is #1. It needs mass trading and circulating supply should also be taken into account. <SEP> nope thats not true its marketcap is then #1 <SEP> it would get mass circulation and supply if it would be listed on the point of attention <SEP> I didn't mean #1 marketcap <SEP> but index mafia as i said prevents that to protect their bitcoin miner centristic world <SEP> I mean #1 as in most current economic value <SEP> what is "current economic value"? <SEP> You're trying to bring up problems unrelated to Ethereum to be problematic. Do you have questions I can try to answer or should I leave you alone? <SEP> i asked at the begining about ether <SEP> @KingScorpio hello someoen can help me regarding ethereum have some questions <SEP> And I'm asking what your questions are. <SEP> is it decoupled now and not needed on ethereum network like media are saying? <SEP> What's "it"? <SEP> ETHER <SEP> You never clarified that. <SEP> People are saying Ether isn't needed on the network and everyone could just set a gas price of 0 and move on. <SEP> so whats with Ether is it the gas not anymore? <SEP> No. It is the gas. People are saying miners don't care about the gas fees. <SEP> gas price of 0 is possible? or is it now a gas price as percentage of transaction sum <SEP> It is possible. <SEP> but for creating a smart contract you need ether still? <SEP> ... nope. You need gas. You pay what you want for gas. <SEP> It was never 'needed'. <SEP> But you won't get your TX mined <SEP> It's a half truth. Ether is still needed. Even if miner's didn't care about the gas fees, everyone would have to switch for 0 gas fee TXs to be processed. <SEP> That said, miners do care. Gas fees surpass the block reward, last I checked. Increasing the block reward increases inflation. <SEP> so there is now the option to do transaction for 0 ether? <SEP> in theory but not practically <SEP> There always was, however, your TX won't be mined for a long time. <SEP> Gas prices incentive miners to mine your TX. With no incentive.. <SEP> and thats it but ether is still the gas of ethereum plattform? <SEP> Ether was never gas. It's a utility token to pay for gas. <SEP> jes and then people in social media showed up and said ether is going to drop <SEP> where did Vitalik say this?

<SEP> Hi can anyone please suggest a good documentation for compiling and deploying smart contract through compiler ? TIA  <SEP> @naveed-raza you got this? http://ethdocs.org <SEP> @computereasy  yes CREATE takes the the value transferred to the new contract as input <SEP> Anyone can give some advices and comments on this question?

Working fine  But when i check mining log i am getting log like  "block became an uncle"  ``` INFO  <SEP>  @adneerav uncles have nothing to do with your smart contract they are orphaned blocks which give a little bit reward nevertheless don't know how you could produce them on your private chain as the only node though... <SEP> ? Thanks <SEP> Also, what about the `block.number` property, any real world attack towards smart contract by exploiting the usage of `block.number`? <SEP> Could anyone shed some lights on the mismatch here? Thanks a lot!

<SEP> Hey everyone.. How much work would it really take for a company like Alibaba to pivot to BlockChain technology? <SEP> I am working on a BlockChain based platform which would create an open marketplace for businesses but concerned about competition from Amazon and Alibaba. With their platforms being central server based I can't imagine that they can pivot to BlockChain easily but I am not a developer hence my question <SEP> hello ,  what is the type of algorithm used by the ethereum ? thanks <SEP> @rtm226_twitter: My experience with established companies and the blockchain is that they usually don't embrace it, ( else banks would be flocking to it). The reason could be that at the top there is usually a CEO and board whose main job is to  keep the business going in a smooth way, so they might perceive it as a risk. I am not sure about your project, but I believe that if it something you feel passionate about you  should do it. <SEP> @KenoLeon thank you for the quick reply. Definately something I am passionate about and we are working on but since the concept is similiar to that of Alibaba and Amazon wanted to see from a coding/developer perspective how difficult or easy it would be to pivot <SEP> I did not think it would be easy and since we are a startup could give us a huge first mover competitive advantage being a BlockChain based company.. The future is moving to BlockChain just a matter of time <SEP> also @KenoLeon  if interested I can send you some more info on the project <SEP> Hey Buddy! Check this out to get started on the spec. address An Ethereum address represents an account. For EOA, the address is derived as the last 20 bytes of the public key controlling the account, e.g., cd2a3d9f938e13cd947ec05abc7fe734df8dd826. This is a hexadecimal format (base 16 notation), which is often indicated explicitly by appending 0x to the address. Web3.js and console functions accept addresses with or without this prefix but for transparency we encourage their use. Since each byte of the address is represented by 2 hex characters, a prefixed address is 42 characters long. Several apps and APIs are also meant to implement the new checksum-enabled address scheme introduced in the Mist Ethereum wallet as of version 0.5.0. <SEP> remember you're building a Dapp on an existing blockchain. DOn't over complicate it. :)) <SEP> And don't use javascript. Ue go or c. If you have to use Electron, hide your Node S <SEP> Hey ghviop88. it's https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining <SEP> know all these words. Gas, Gas Price, bla bla bla... block chains evolve. When was the last time you mined a bitcoin? http://www.ethdocs.org/en/latest/glossary.html
<SEP> thx <SEP> When I close the console, then the node does not run in the background anymore right? <SEP> @gernotpokorny In windows environment, you know what will happened... hahaha :smile: <SEP> @AliceTheHive What? What will happen? Or do you mean nobody knows? :) <SEP> Perhaps... run a virtual box/machine :smile:   Or you  can try closing the console...see what happens... :smile:   Or you can run geth as a daemon in a linux virtual box in a Windows machine :smile:
<SEP> why can not i transit etc from ledger to bittrex ? transit errors for 2 days???? <SEP> sorry eth <SEP> hi there, I ordered from litebit some ethereum , I tried to load wallet but after 2 days of loading blocks etc I got to the point that I was out of space on my hard disk (it's ssd 120GB) I deleted every single program so to empty space but It still got all the available space to load and it needed some more.So I decided to uninstal and reinstal to another Hard disk on my computer ( F:/ instead of C:/ ) Now It loads with a new wallet address ...I have my previous adress and I think I have the secret key as well. My questions are 3 1. Can I recover the ethereum or they are lost for ever? 2. Can I load the wallet on F:/ or it goes by default to C:/ And I will still need more space to load it ?  3.

At the moment either coinbase (or binance) keep track of what you own. If you don't know what a private key is maybe it is best to leave it to those companies. <SEP> okay thank you so much so i'm not doing myself any harm by not having my wallet <SEP> No. <SEP> Also If binance is full right now and not taking new users do you guys recommend anything besides binance? I saw good things about kucoin any suggestions there <SEP> this is to sign up my brother <SEP> If at some point you want full control over your funds then you will need a wallet to manage your key. <SEP> thank you for that so much <SEP> Note: If you lose your key, you lose the funds. If someone else gets a hold of your key, he can take your funds. There are no refunds, and no one to call. <SEP> @JPudelka_twitter Also If binance is full right now and not taking new users do you guys recommend anything besides binance?

It's the first film to be funded by cryptocurrency. If we are able to raise our budget using Vulture Capital, we would like to create a production company that works with the cryptocurrency community for future projects. For our next project, wed like to have coin holders be able to vote of what gets greenlit. This way Vulture Capital not only makes you an investor, but an active producer. It will also keep us, as film makers, honest and decentralized. <SEP> @Bunjin Thanks. <SEP> What we need for this to show it worth is for the Ether community's support to reach out goal. <SEP> Hi, can anyone help me with Myst for Win64?

You should know if they call it. <SEP> OR you should expect it, and it will fail. That's the smart contract version. You allow a contract to spend X. They try it. It knows if it succeeds or fails. <SEP> TBH, that's why that call exists. Smart Contracts. <SEP> how about getting all the "input" data to contract and scan it for my address? <SEP> But you can also track the event history of the contract <SEP> if i try i, then i need to spend gas to check weather it works or not.. <SEP> But people won't randomly allow it lol. <SEP> No <SEP> Use call instead of creating a TX <SEP> Event history.

How is ether stored? Is there a digital wallet you recommend? <SEP> @aimiloo_twitter hey check out Mist if you want a full featured wallet that stores the blockchain on your computer  for something a bit more lightweight check out MetaMask  for something very secure check out the Ledger Nano S + the included software or MyEtherWallet.com <SEP> @morgansliman k. so that's the best you can do to help then its obvious why ETC is gonna be worth more than ETH, community is shit, mist is shit, and the fact i have this issue is garbage

<SEP> hello <SEP> hi <SEP> im a new developer and im trying to develop a crypto based website <SEP> but i dont seem to understand how to generate wallets for the different crypto <SEP> or connect to the blockchain, could i please get some help <SEP> or just a minor explanation on how to get started, thanks <SEP> what do you mean by crypto based website? <SEP> a site that would be able to generate different wallets for different crypto <SEP> as if i was trying to build an exchange <SEP> i don't quite know how to navigate the source code or even what the source is used for <SEP> what you are asking for is very broad. do you have programming experience <SEP> some, in php <SEP> but im willing to learn <SEP> well, you can't build a ship without knowing how to build a raft <SEP> i found this: https://dharma.io/tutorial <SEP> say i wanted to build a site where me user could deposit ether if he/she wanted, im not sure how i would generate the address <SEP> ohh thank you very much <SEP> Hm! <SEP> Why not just post a wallet address for donations? <SEP> @test00162280_twitter just tell me user to send its ether to me address <SEP> https://etherenvoy.com/ thoughts on a simple donations comment at the bottom? I don't see how that would be bad. <SEP> i would like each user to have a unique address <SEP> You mean you'd like to hide the company address? <SEP> its specific for a new idea im trying to develop <SEP> Ok, well -- there will be 3x the transaction fees then, because to transfer in = fee, to transfer out to your real address= fee... then to spend it = the third fee... If you ever intend to use that ETH that went in, you'd be hurting yourself. <SEP> lastly -- this is pointless -- because people will see where the transaction goes afterwards since the blockchain is public. <SEP> i dont mind people seeing the transaction <SEP> explain the use case then? <SEP> my project would be to build a website where each individual will be able to generate a crypto address to have as their own <SEP> like a wallet <SEP> or exchange <SEP> so i cant just have 1 address for users to deposit <SEP> each user must have a different ether address <SEP> i wanted to know, to achieve this, do i use the source code of each coin <SEP> Might be a cool idea to allow users to transact on the exchange directly via metamask and their own wallet -- rather than giving your ETH away to a third party. <SEP> There exists an exchange with code you can check <SEP> bisq <SEP> opensource p2p platform <SEP> they support eth <SEP> i'd check how they implemented it <SEP> ohh cool <SEP> only existing p2p exchange i think <SEP>  so then how to exchanges like poloniex or cryptopia generate addresses for their millions of users <SEP> i was looking for more of a solution like that <SEP> They probably just throw money at it and hire a team of programmers. <SEP> ^_^ <SEP> Shitty exchanges get hacked and lose all their funds <SEP> And good exchanges get hacked too <SEP> I'd be extremely careful touching that problem. <SEP> the keys would need to be super secure. <SEP> thank you <SEP> be firstly i need to be able to generate the address before i start to worry about security

The network hash rate is about 80 TH/s, do the math. <SEP> is it still valid? <SEP> @PeterSkrzyniarz_twitter this is experimental technology, not  for end users you did not do your research and lost your funds in a highly speculative value you did not understand <SEP> so, you were the "moron" who was "too stupid" <SEP> @lapitsrepo your questions are answered here: http://ethdocs.org btw, there are several decentralized market projects already, starting with OpenBazaar
<SEP>  <SEP>  <SEP> Hi, my ethereum wallet is not syncing. I want to send some eth to exchange. I managed to send once a small amount without syncing, all other attempts to send some units out fail. Also, after I sent out some units, the wallet does not update the number. I still see the number of units which was there before some units have gone.  Do I need to sync to send out the units? Can I reinstall the wallet? <SEP> can't get Linux server going <SEP> http://ppa.launchpad.net/ethereum/ethereum/ubuntu/dists/jessie/main/binary-amd64/Packages <SEP> @Sisyphus01 There is no I/O in the Ethereum VM.   It is a closed system, where your smart contracts run in a sandbox.   They can have their own state (stored on the blockchain), and can read and write to that, or call other smart contracts, but that's it.    Reading from a CSV is not possible, because they aren't only running locally.   You need to populate them with calls to them passing parameters.  http://solidity.readthedocs.org has all the info. <SEP> @bobbykennedy The 'JIT VM' for Geth has been in testing for several months and is significantly faster than the Interpreter.    It will likely be made the default soon enough.  A random selection of nodes are being defaulted to the JIT to get broader testing.   If you aren't comfortable with being one of those then you can switch it off as per the message.    If you've got further questions on that, head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum.    I don't work on geth myself, and my knowledge goes no further than that, I'm afraid! <SEP> @ekkis @bobbykennedy @stuffyvater @sassh Sorry that you are having such a painful time with your syncs.    Please head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/mist to report your issues.   Best wishes <SEP> If you plan on being an ethereum dapp developer, is a asus rog sufficient or do you need a customized rig with significant GPU performance <SEP> GPU is not required to develop DApps <SEP> You can avoid mining altogether with tools like testrpc

I use, I thought,  an average amount of gas. The transaction hasn't appeared on the chain, though the amount of ether hasn't been subtracted from my balance either and in my wallet I see that the transaction itself is now no longer pending, though it was for a couple of hours. Has this transaction been rejected? Did I use too little gas? Is that amount of ether still 'reserved' and waiting for processing or has that transaction been cancelled? I know this is probably an irritating question for the more advanced among you but i'd appreciate some help! <SEP> @WanderingConsciousness i got same question

Sharding is being used as research for scalability on the protocol level.. <SEP> @alexvandesande Yeah I know, but nowdays is it possible to do? <SEP> What exactly are you trying to do? <SEP> I'm currently using ethereum in a project <SEP> @MiquelGatiusF but what do you hope to accomplish with sharing? <SEP> *sharding <SEP> i want to improve the performance of the server <SEP> that's the main goal of sharding isn't it? <SEP> The goal is to improve the performance of the ethereum network. You cant improve just your server with it (unless you are talking about making a new project using ethereum code) <SEP> That's what I wanted to say. As you can see im not an expert <SEP> Anyways how do I improve the performance of the ethereum network? I have been looking for information and nothing was found. <SEP> @Jair54  <SEP> I began mining with "ethminer and ethminer -G", but; I get this at the command promt:JSON-RPC problem.

<SEP> Hi Guys <SEP> do you know if PoS will be a part of Metropolis ? <SEP> Dear all!, I'm trying to make a crowdsale test in the rikenby testnet. The funding limit is just 10 ether and the crowdsale will last 1 hour. <SEP> I would appreciate greatly if you could help with this. <SEP> @metabol Not yet, but I just found a web page with something else to try. <SEP> @adamskrodzki I've watched many youtube vids but most are MS Windows/OSX and the one Linux version I did find was an old 2016 vid using a compile method and seemed very out of date.  Now that I have the wallet installed (which is executing from a folder essentially), I ended up closing the wizard prompting for me to deposit BTC before I can use my wallet...very misleading...(i think).  If I already own ETH, is this step still necessary or is it just assumed that since I'm not importing a .json that I own zero ETH?  I've since opened the wallet back up and now see the GUI and the options for running the lite version.  The question now is it as simple as using my Account Address as the destination address when sending ETH from my exchange or do I need a Wallet Contract first?  @Azmora Thx, I'm learning more about Mist now...lot's of reading today =) <SEP> In order to participate, just send at the rikenby tesnet address: 0x4F48bD073A06cf199F1447a818753D33150Be609 at least 1 ether (the token price). <SEP> This is the SimplestCrowdsale contract. <SEP> Ant the token name is SimplestCoin, or simply Sims. <SEP> @pingram3541 You're welcome. I'm learning a lot still. It is a brave new world. Lol!! <SEP> @pingram3541 You do not need ant bitcoin or ether to setup the wallet. <SEP> @pingram3541, you can send ether from an exchange after you have the address in Mist. But do not forget your password! Otherwise you will lost the ethers. I recommend try with some small amout first. <SEP> @Azmora Yes TY!  I just successfully transferred .01 ETH from my exchange.  I notice the account address remains the same.  Is there similar best practice to BTC wallets where I can/should generate new addresses for each transaction? <SEP> @pingram3541, I don't know. I didn't see anything simple. But you can create new accounts in Mist. <SEP> There is an "add account" in blue. <SEP> Thx for all your help, doing some more reading up...looks like I can do it a couple different ways, new acct or sub-contract within another acct <SEP> Someone send 2 ethers for the SimplestCrowdsale! Thank you!!! <SEP> I think I forgot to mention the address of the SimplestCoin. It is 0x7CD307B4D40a2953f45a2995D5de0d589241C1e1 <SEP> In order to participate, just send at the rikenby tesnet address: 0x4F48bD073A06cf199F1447a818753D33150Be609 at least 1 ether (the token price). <SEP> ------------------------------------------------ Dear all!, I'm trying to make a crowdsale test in the rikenby testnet.

Background: been interested and following since the beginning, got the cli's when ETH was @ .80, slacked off for a while and now I'm back. Started trading on poloniex, got some eth in my most wallet.

Anybody waiting on an answer, or got a question?   I'll be here for a bit.
<SEP> Good question <SEP> hi all....what would the correct channel be for suggestions on the documentation initiative? <SEP> Isn't that misleading? Like i said people could sue over this kind of confusion. <SEP> Hey @benjyz  Head to https://reddit.com/r/ethtrader for that.   Bunch of people there. <SEP> LMAO you can't downvote in there <SEP> Wow <SEP> Yeah, ethtrader seems more for investors, not developers. <SEP> RIght, @benjyz, so probably https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum for tech questions on that. <SEP> @ALscientific_twitter "hi all....what would the correct channel be for suggestions on the documentation initiative?"  The http://ethdocs.org documentation is based at https://github.com/ethereum/homestead-guide and we discuss that at https://gitter.im/ethereum/homestead-guide, if that is what you meant? <SEP> @bobsummerwill  nice, thank you <SEP> @Zoltu @benjyz I would just take that to https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum.  99% of clients are geth. It's on-topic. <SEP> Yes, @benjyz. See distribution of nodes in http://ethernodes.org/network/1, which also currently shows all ETH + ETC + Expanse + Shift + Krypton nodes. <SEP> Really?  The exchanges aren't using EthereumJ?  I assumed they would be. <SEP> what is Shift and Krypton? <SEP> So, @ALscientific_twitter, with timezones and it being the weekend, etc. you may or may not get an immediate response on any of the channels.   Don't sweat it.    Ask your questions.   You'll get replies. <SEP> @benjyz Other Ethereum-alts. <SEP> @Zoltu I don't know.   I would assume that they are following the same kind of usage patterns as everybody else. <SEP> Also, Java is still the dominant (by far) backend language so I assumed most of the backends for exchanges were Java (and therefore EthereumJ).  Of course, this is all speculation.

<SEP> @3esmit ethereum is public as well share right as multiple groups can have multiple chains <SEP> for example, i can run a supply chain business as well voting system within the same Ethereum <SEP> but Bitcoin is strictly not shared as it serves only one purpose - money transfer <SEP> thats why i am thinking if  Ethereum is public and shared <SEP> Please share your thoughts @3esmit <SEP> I think Ethereum is a unpermissioned distributed ledger... <SEP> That would be my definition <SEP> Ethereum is a decentralised platform for  <SEP> The point is, that Bitcoin-like system can be deployed inside ethereum through a smart contract <SEP> Bitcoin itself have no technological advantages over Ethereum. Only advantages of bitcoin is wider acceptance (there are markets that actually accept bitcoin) and market size <SEP> Other advantage of the Bitcoin system is that is well more tested, and also, may be controversal, but being simple is an advantage at the security level - there are less things that can go wrong. <SEP> In other hand, Bitcoin have several disavantages over Ethereum in the tecnological side, to start the limitation of quantity and type of operations this network can perform, other disavantage is weaker PoW that allows people to use AISC to mine in a hardware built for minimal mining of Bitcoin. <SEP> AISC mining itself is a big problem, since it centralized the power of mining and also, as AISC-only mining rigs are limited to 1MB blocks of bitcoin and other specifications of the current protocol, so if bitcoin network changes this mining rigs become trash, this makes less interesting for big miners to update to a new bitcoin <SEP> Ethereum didn't wanted to replace Bitcoin, it wanted to work with Bitcoin, but the current (in)governance of bitcoin and toxic community is making this difficult.  I think in the end, bitcoin will become obsolete due superior tecnologies like ZCash (Zero proof cash) or even ethereum. <SEP> It's like Bitcoin is religion for some, so they don't want to touch the sacred protocol and keep all this way forever.
<SEP> real quick any one can link me to a POS contract explanation? <SEP> i need to deploy a Proof of stake contract <SEP> is casper supported yet ? <SEP> @amazinreviews_twitter  you dont need to ask permission to fork ethereum.

How can i get it back i tried contacting them via support and no response.  They have deleted my withdrawal # number and the support ticket.  Eth should be responsible to tell the crypto community to avoid yobit and even stop trading their coins on there.  I hear it has happened to many people.
<SEP> I did a withdrawal from an exchange to another one. I got the confirmation with an tx id. But etherscan does not find anything with the tx id. this was 5 hours ago. Is there anything I can do? <SEP> It is beginning to sound more and more every day that if you ever send from an exchange then you should send to your own wallet first <SEP> why? <SEP> 00-1e-52-cd-a8-e3 ... i wish someone would contact me to resolve some major issues ... ethereum was boosted with most of my bitcoin from core 1,2 and 3 .. 2008 nothing was being mined. i had to buy the first and second sha and also traded in i,G and forex before 2009 . i am the victim of maybe the biggest ever scam and fraud and i feel like nothing is being done to assist me here .. im no pro  developer but maybe just luck at the rite time back then .. this is huge serious effect global im sure. <SEP> this might happen if I sent to my personal wallet, too. The tx is not getting into a block. <SEP> But then you would only need to open one support ticket with one exchange

The Jaxx servers have the blockchain downloaded and then the phone just asks the servers for the nonce and current balance <SEP> thank you so much for the explanation <SEP> You can receive using Jaxx too, but theoretically they could lie to you about having actually recieved the tx <SEP> np
<SEP> hello <SEP> Hello.. I just downloaded ethereum on my mac and I'm trying to figure out how to mine within the "test-net" environment !? <SEP> I'm using their wallet; created a new account. But am clueless after this point. Plz share some pointers <SEP> You will need to install Geth <SEP> @dograba When I invoke the "Ethereum Wallet", I see that geth is invoked automatically. I did a "ps" on the command line and did verify that geth was running <SEP> This is the first ever time I'm exploring ethereum; during the setup, one of the instructions said that I could start mining by going to the developer section in menu. But I don't see those options in the wallet ! <SEP> @dranjith01_twitter are  you on the testnet? What do you have on the developer menu? <SEP> @alexvandesande yep, I'm on testnet. I see "Wallets", "Send" & "Contracts" on the top menu <SEP> ehh... Is that not the developer menu !? <SEP> the application menu <SEP> Which system are you on? Mac, windows, linux? <SEP> mac <SEP> Those are top tabs, not the menu <SEP> Ok. The app menu is on the top of your screen <SEP> Thanks much Alex.. I feel so dumb now :) <SEP> ;-) <SEP> I was looking at the GUI in shorter format (not maximized), so missed the top menu.. ughh <SEP> does the test-net actually replicate the real ethereum blockchain ? Does that mean I'd have to wait a long time before I see any ethers from my mining <SEP> The app menu still exist when not maximized.. <SEP> the testnet has a lower difficulty <SEP> Did you find the option that says start mining? Must be the last optoon on the menu <SEP> Alternatively you can press ctrl + shift +M <SEP> I don't think you will get notification but your account balance would change I guess <SEP> I'd imagine so.. Sounds like waiting game for now.. I'll get back to reading the documentation. Hoping to be active in this forum and get involved in deeper subjects.. Thank you both @dograba & @alexvandesande <SEP> What's your intention if you don't mind me asking? <SEP> I see. I was looking for someone who could build a proof of concept for me. <SEP> Sent the invite <SEP> hello ,would ur geth kill itself auto frequently? <SEP> Probably a popular topic - but any idea what is wrong with ETH network? <SEP> I see Bittrex has the wallet frozen <SEP> they say it's due to some problem with geth and a new version is to fix it?
<SEP> Hello... <SEP>  <SEP> **nothing** <SEP>  <SEP> ! <SEP> I am chinese,can't say En. <SEP> bitcoin in china is very hot,but gov. close the trade <SEP>  ~~hahaha~~ <SEP> ~~interest~~ <SEP>  <SEP> yes, we buy vpn over the wall; <SEP> hey! i had some ethereum conceptual questions regarding state and trust in the network, is there someone who might be able to answer? <SEP> So, I know you can replay all the transactions from the genesis state to the current block in Bitcoin, mainly because the UTXO pool is manageable. Can you do a similar thing in Ethereum? Is it possible to obtain the entire series of events that have occurred on the network to bring it to the current state, in terms of the State, Transactions and Receipt Patricia Tries? Thanks in advance!

Coin is not a share as I know or what I am not understanding? Fee is going to Ethereum Foundation as i know. <SEP> @popporoo_twitter you got the whole concept wrong <SEP> check this to understand http://ethdocs.org <SEP> Thanks :) I got little more specific answer from Finnish Facebook-group.

Would someone please pat me on the head (respond to this post) just to show I am learning. <SEP> No :P <SEP> Thank you so much. <SEP> @annavladi All tokens are collaterized in one way or another. It could be a service, a product, company shares, gold bullion. <SEP> Just like US Dollars, Euros, etc... <SEP> Like what? <SEP> @annavladi The Token itself doesnt know what it represents. There are many people working on connecting tokens to real assets.  You can programm anything you like into the token. Ethereum is turing complete <SEP> Can you have a Solidity contract murder someone? <SEP> If no, it's not Schwarzenegger complete. <SEP> @kayabaNerve  No the contract cant murder. but it could incentivise murder. <SEP> @rockacola There is a faucet, use it. <SEP> So not Schwarzeneggar complete <SEP> @phalexo I only able to find one for ETH, which I had no problem obtain and do my learning <SEP> @rockacola Since eth is free, just create a simple token yourself. <SEP> Yes^^ <SEP> @phalexo I see. How about if I wish to test interactions with existing, established ERC20s?

It was a failed project. <SEP> @abouali50   you can change the network on the top right. So you have to make sure youre on the right network <SEP> But I had an ehereum account linked to it. I thought since PE was no more, I could store my eth in that account. <SEP> Does it mean I can not recover <SEP> @OdiohPatrick_twitter  have you ever provided your private key to project ethereum ? Lookes like you are  not the only one with the key to this wallet <SEP> No, I have never done that <SEP> I have not shared my PK to anyone <SEP> @OdiohPatrick_twitter what is the projectethereum wallet? <SEP> Do you mean PE ethereum wallet address <SEP> @OdiohPatrick_twitter Which client are you using? how did you generate your address? Obviously someone has the key to your  address, how did this happen <SEP> I can no longer access PE website. I git the PK from my PE account. I kept  it safe. <SEP> My PK was on my PE account. <SEP> But after copying it, I opted for hide PK, and it was no longer showing in my PE account. <SEP> But I can not access PE website again, seems site is down <SEP> I got both my address and PK from my projectetherium account. <SEP> @OdiohPatrick_twitter  So PE generated your address, this means they could have stored the PK and now they could have swiped your wallet. <SEP> I copied both of them and kept them safe <SEP> Do I can not recover a dime. <SEP> Thats heart breaking <SEP> I was told myether wallet is the safest. <SEP> @OdiohPatrick_twitter  yes it is, did you generate the key on MEW? <SEP> No,  it was on my PE account. <SEP> MEW should add google authetication to PK, to prevent others from being hacked . this is very painful to say the least.

<SEP> i send ether from my coin base wallet to main account etherbase and ether disappears and is nowhere gone! why is that and that ether goes??? <SEP> where that ether disappears??? <SEP> @goldsaker This is not possible by design. <SEP> just happened <SEP> and did it just to try it <SEP> use this tool to have a better view http://etherscan.io/ <SEP> put your address there, where the ether came from <SEP> @goldsaker coinbase have schedules to sendout coins, and may take some minutes for this happens, depends on their infrastructure and application rules. This is why in ethereum we are working for descentralized exchanges, like etherdelta, but in etherdelta you can only buy ether based tokens, not ether from fiat.
<SEP> anyone showing mist still on version 0.8.8 after downloading 0.8.10? <SEP> also, anyone here happen to use qtminer? <SEP> Somebody can tell me why is it important for Mist to sync all Ethereum Blockchain everytime?

Thx in advance!  <SEP> Also updated to last version 8.10 but had to downgrade it again due to it was way more sloooooow than the 8.9  <SEP> @xibot you want a smaller blockchain? delete chaindata dir and sync from scratch; as long as you do not interrupt the process, it will only load the headers and need much less diskspace <SEP> or use parity wallet <SEP> yeah it still has me on 0.8.8, odd. <SEP> qtminer keeps freezing when grabbing dag though, seems to be an issue today from what i can see on reddit. <SEP> Oh! Sh*t! Haven't seen that folder! I see that there a bunch of .ldb numbered files! So those are the blocks storage? @hegrz <SEP> yes <SEP> Once sync I should delete all? But not the last one? @hegrz <SEP> no, if you delete anything you will have to sync again <SEP> just saying that if you delete all and sync from scratch, the data will be much smaller <SEP> but it will take time again to sync <SEP> But it will sync 80GB again or just the 30GB avg as at 1st sync? <SEP> even less <SEP> IF you keep im fast mode = do not interrupt the wallet <SEP> Wow! <SEP> So once sync I close Mist & then delete all .ldb files from chaindata dir? I does not has anything to do with wallet/keys/pass/etc, right? I mean by deleting .ldb from chaindata dir, right? @hegrz <SEP> delete the whole chaindata/ dir <SEP> NOT keystore/ <SEP> backup keystore/! <SEP> Delete just the .ldb files or the complete chaindata folder? <SEP> whatever you like <SEP> Ok!

<SEP> hello <SEP> I am looking for the best source code for ethereum to run over an api <SEP> @jjones151 http://ethdocs.org/ <SEP> I am using Ethereum wallet with test network. I am unable to sync my ether with the wallet. Please help. It is stuck at 99% since last 2 hours. <SEP> @gk1227 I am facing the same issue. Did you get any solution? <SEP> ppv999 Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be any developers or anyone with a great deal of expertise who is very active in the chatrooms. <SEP> @ppv999 ^ <SEP> @ppv999 There appears to be two things that you need for sync the blocks and the states. When I used geth directly what seemed to happen is that the you had to get all the state entries again if your restarted the client and when you reach a certain number of blocks it stops downloading blocks and will wait for you to get all state entries before continuing <SEP> The total state entries I had to get was 68422972 <SEP> That took probably ~8hrs for me <SEP> The blocks still haven't finished and are coming in far slower than before, but I don't want to risk restarting geth because it may have to get all the state entries again. <SEP> @ndji Thanks @ndji for the response. Any idea how do I check the total number of state entries? <SEP> If you're using the geth console. "eth.syncing" <SEP> @ppv999 ^ <SEP> @ppv999 oh, since you're using the wallet you may be able to connect to the instance of geth that the wallet starts by downloading geth and starting it with "geth.attach" <SEP> then you would probably be able to use eth.syncing to see where it's at. Again, I'm new as well so I'm not sure. <SEP> sorry the command would be geth attach no dot

<SEP> Hello! I am venezuelan <SEP> Do you know PETRO? <SEP> https://discord.gg/xVFpm56 Take a look at this. Opinion ? <SEP> @juanbgonzaleze_twitter Hello! I am venezuelan Do you know PETRO? <SEP> @unknownhostname  i got the same problem :worried: <SEP> I don't know about those things.
<SEP> hii <SEP> team , by using the ethereum blockchain i want to send secure messages <SEP> is it possible way to do so? <SEP> Yes, although currently you have to encrypt the messages yourself <SEP> yes i can do that,Any suggestion for the apps or source code to which are doing the same to send the bitmessage on blockchain <SEP> yup <SEP> @sighanchi2000 of course, but why? <SEP> More specifically, lots of people are just starting coins just because: https://coinmarketcap.com/ <SEP> Most of them fail unless they're solving a bigger problem <SEP>  I don't have any ether, just DAO, so I dont think I can pay the gas cost :( <SEP> If someone can send me enough ether to cover gas (is 0.1 eth enough for several transactions?) I can send you double whatever you send me after I withdraw my dao <SEP> just buy some from coinbase <SEP> if you need ether <SEP> @chafey when I go to coinbase it doesn't give me an option for ETH. Also, it only has my old bank account in it, so I would have to wait a couple days to get my account set up, and Im doing this right now because I'm in the middle of a move (including moving banks) and I want to have access to the money I have in DAO right now <SEP> the vast majority of my net worth is in DAO atm <SEP> look harder, coinbase has an option for eth and you can use a credit card to get up to $300 instantlhy <SEP> if you have any value of significance in DAO, you certainly have the means to get ether without asking for a random donation :) <SEP> @chafey I did not know about credit card transactions! Thanks! <SEP> @chafey You'd think that, but I bought the initial eth in the presale using bitcoin that I got for a funny reddit post and some mspaint dick art I made a few years ago <SEP> you're right I can buy 1 eth tho lol <SEP> @chafey how come under "Currency" in buy/sell there's only a Bitcoin button? <SEP> there is a eth button for me <SEP> hnnnnnnnngggggggggg they want to do charge verification and I never figured out how to work my dumb bank's website <SEP> (its a debit card) <SEP> seems like that would be something for you to figure out if you have significant value your about to transfer into it <SEP> @chafey Nah, I'm just trying to figure out the DAO thing right now. I'm not transfering anything to a bank until I get a new bank account in the area I'm moving to <SEP> my bank got bought out by a different bank a few months ago, and since then everything has been wacky <SEP> I used to have Old National now its Mid-Illinois First Bank and Trust or something like that <SEP> I'll just do this in a week when I have a new bank account
<SEP> hi i've unused linux vps with 8 core and 4gb ram. how start? <SEP> @FreshGijon_twitter I would guess that it will go down.  Most people use ethereum because it is trusted.  A fork will hurt that trust.  I think the amount lost doing the fork is vastly more than lost if we don't   It is two bad choices, kinda like the American Presidential Election. <SEP> But one is worse than the other.  Just like Hillary is way worse. <SEP> how start what? <SEP> @FalconwingYaz_twitter here are themes like that for WP   https://colorlib.com/wp/best-one-page-wordpress-themes/ <SEP> how start mining <SEP> @renwang1612 Look up your address on  etherchain.org   It will show you all transactions to do with it. <SEP> @mrprunen Here is a mining guide.   http://emeraldcomputers.com/ethereum/how-to-mine-ethereum-quickly/   I am not sure you have the hardware for it.   I think VPS won't do it.  You need a GPU that has at least 2GB of RAM just for the GPU. <SEP> 8 core is not enough? <SEP> cores don't matter.....single core works just fine...CPU's can't mine this, only GPU.... <SEP> Technically CPU can mine, but at like 1% the speed. <SEP> nifty gitter page plugin
<SEP> any suggestions for faucets like rinkeby.io ?? <SEP> so they re-centralize the concept <SEP> still in development phase
<SEP> @AndraTechnology hola, estaba lejos... Thank you for the answer - I'll keep asking from time to time, hopefully people won't mind =D <SEP> ...more condensed repeat: Anyone know of a way to use Ethereum without UDP or incoming TCP? <SEP> I don't think that is possible, @triple9dice. You can learn more about the networking model of Ethereum at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO0WRKmXinQ <SEP> ahhh, that's too bad <SEP> I will watch the video - any idea if there are plans for that to change? <SEP> See also https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/rlpx.md. <SEP> mmm <SEP> That's too bad. Looks like my particular use case won't work with ethereum after all =/ <SEP> I think it's impossible to achieve, because the network models are incompatible.    I was talking to Alex Leverington about this a while back, and he thought that it would actually be possible to build a better Tor on top of the RLPx, but when he had talked to the Tor developers they didn't really have much interest in "building a new Internet".    Their focus was really just on providing a drop-in alternative to our current setup. <SEP> Ethereum on top of Tor.   Not so much. <SEP> Well, I haven't read the link or watched the video you sent yet, so I can't really comment... but it's disappointing <SEP> Hrmph. Okay, I took a look. It's way too over-complicated for my needs, which is simply receiving and sending ether while maintaining my personal privacy. Perhaps I'll try to find or setup a 3rd party website with an API. Thanks for the links <SEP> I'm I guess having trouble understanding the use between the terms 'smart contracts' and software. Vinay Gupta says in the youtube video that smart contracts are software. I guess I don't understand the nuance/difference between those two terms. <SEP> sorry, he said "smart contracts store software in blockchains" <SEP> when I hear the term contract I think piece of paper with signature on it... <SEP> thanks bob for clarification <SEP> Have a watch of this if you have time  ... where Gavin Wood talks about "crypto law" and "allegality" ...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh9BxYTSrGU

Unzip it Double-click index.html MyEtherWallet is now running entirely on your computer In case you are not familiar, you need to keep the entire folder in order to run the website, not just index.html. Don't touch or move anything around in the folder. Once it's running go click the DAO page in the footer and click all the red buttons More info: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5lqx90/announcing_myetherwallet_v34_the_node_switcher/ <SEP> This is the easiest and safer way to do it ;) <SEP> https://medium.com/curator-multisig-phf-official-channel/dao-token-holders-come-claim-your-money-b428f186572a#.2fjqrt60p <SEP> well, I was using mist wallet <SEP> It will be easier to use this solution. You can use Mist Account file in MyEtherWallet. <SEP> Hi. Are there any r/ethereum mods in here? I did a post about an hour ago with info on IDEX, our new decentralized exchange that we just launched today, and the post is not showing up in new. Seems it was flagged as spam <SEP> If any one in here has the ability to get that out of the spam filter that would be great.

<SEP>  <SEP>  <SEP> Hi, my ethereum wallet is not syncing. I want to send some eth to exchange. I managed to send once a small amount without syncing, all other attempts to send some units out fail. Also, after I sent out some units, the wallet does not update the number. I still see the number of units which was there before some units have gone.  Do I need to sync to send out the units? Can I reinstall the wallet? <SEP> can't get Linux server going <SEP> http://ppa.launchpad.net/ethereum/ethereum/ubuntu/dists/jessie/main/binary-amd64/Packages <SEP> @Sisyphus01 There is no I/O in the Ethereum VM.   It is a closed system, where your smart contracts run in a sandbox.   They can have their own state (stored on the blockchain), and can read and write to that, or call other smart contracts, but that's it.    Reading from a CSV is not possible, because they aren't only running locally.   You need to populate them with calls to them passing parameters.  http://solidity.readthedocs.org has all the info. <SEP> @bobbykennedy The 'JIT VM' for Geth has been in testing for several months and is significantly faster than the Interpreter.    It will likely be made the default soon enough.  A random selection of nodes are being defaulted to the JIT to get broader testing.   If you aren't comfortable with being one of those then you can switch it off as per the message.    If you've got further questions on that, head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/go-ethereum.    I don't work on geth myself, and my knowledge goes no further than that, I'm afraid! <SEP> @ekkis @bobbykennedy @stuffyvater @sassh Sorry that you are having such a painful time with your syncs.    Please head to https://gitter.im/ethereum/mist to report your issues.   Best wishes <SEP> If you plan on being an ethereum dapp developer, is a asus rog sufficient or do you need a customized rig with significant GPU performance <SEP> GPU is not required to develop DApps <SEP> You can avoid mining altogether with tools like testrpc
<SEP> Hello :-) <SEP> has anyone tried mining with a nvidia GTX1080 ? <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter  What address did you send it to? <SEP> @cwhinfrey Sometimes someone GPU mines on the testnet and it ruins CPU mining for everyone else.  Often if you just wait a while they will stop and CPU mining will work again. <SEP> @SunPj Where did you copy your address from?  What is the address you copied? <SEP> @Zoltu I used the one given by the wallet when you want to do a bitcoin deposit 19ePSTjGhDJ3ofdknuCx5Px3oXVSCPeWeP but I never received it <SEP> That isn't a valid address. <SEP> Do you have a screenshot of where you got that? <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter ^ <SEP> that was given to my by the "shifty" thing when you do deposit using bitcoin <SEP> @Zoltu  (thanks) <SEP> The shifty thing? <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter that was probably the Bitcoin address given by Shapeshift. <SEP> Your ethereum address has a hexadecimal format <SEP> @alexvandesande yes alex, was given by the shapeshift, my actual address is : 0x2BB4Fe172cC3ce1C1174B540a6B0Aa7b01C787aF <SEP> Check etherchain.org with that address to see if it was received there <SEP> it was <SEP> Then your wallet is not in sync. <SEP> You need to wait <SEP> it was a week ago <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter Are you using Mist or Geth? <SEP> Or something else (parity, online wallet, etc.) <SEP> @Zoltu he is definitely using Mist, having sync issues. <SEP> I am using the Linux version of the wallet <SEP> Is Test-NET not syncing for anyone else? <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter Do you have the Mist UI open right now? <SEP> yes I do <SEP> ! <SEP> At the top, do you see something like this? <SEP> yes <SEP> The first number is the number of connected peers.  The second number is the current block you are at.  The third number is how long since you last saw a block. <SEP> What do the numbers say for you? <SEP> Healthy looks like this: <SEP> ! <SEP> Well, you want more peers than that.  ~25 is ideal. <SEP> But the current block should be ~1,643,934 <SEP> 25 peers, 1643935, 20 sec since .... <SEP> Hmm, you are in sync. <SEP> @nicolaswilczak_twitter Can you take a screenshot of the whole UI and paste it here? <SEP> Or at least the Accounts section?

One more question if i may. If you send your ether a block too earlier so one block before the ico block are your ethers lost? <SEP> @cavedeluxe_twitter that depends on the token contract. Usually the Contract just throws and your Tx fee is lost but your Eth stay in your account. But you could write a contract to do anything with your Eth
