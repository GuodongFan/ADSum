You create only one instance of the driver for all test cases, so if you have 2 test cases (login and logout test case), first test case will get you logged in and after this test case is finished you will stay logged in, logout test case starts from where first one finished, so you are still logged in, you just need to logout in second test case.

I have a weird problem with my Android testing in which the Appium server stops responding when actions are performed on a page for some time. Actually the exact query failure is random. Either find elements will fail, or scroll will fail or get page source will fail. But there is a limited number of actions I can perform. I am assuming it has got to do with recycler views in android, which might be causing the issue, but I am not sure.   For example, my app is an OTT one like Netflix with swim lanes for categories and multiple categories. So there is vertical scrolling for selecting a category and horizontal scrolling for selecting an asset in the category. If I find a category and then scroll the whole assets horizontally it fails in the validation of the next.  If I don't to any scrolling and validate assets in view and check all categories then it fails after some are validated.  Better if I just scroll up and down also for ten times, then the server gives up after 5-7 scrolls.  Really not sure what to do :-( <SEP> WebDriverException: Message: An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command. Original error: Could not proxy command to remote server.

I try to use 'Send Keys' function and then assert the input field's text equals blank (input values are not filled), but Appium can still send the restricted characters successfully. <SEP> @zarashima   To be honest: 1. this should be a unit test and not a UI test, because this is very time consuming. It also needs to be an API test, because people can still adjust frontend code (if it's a frontend app) and send different chars through the API 2. it's also good to know how the filtering is done, if this is done for example with HTML and a specific attribute, like for example ` <SEP> ok thanks @wswebcreation <SEP> Hello Guys, I am facing one issue, I want to clear the content from text field.

Summarization," <SEP> yeh it's just a GUI wrapper on top of Appium, which is why you can use it to attach onto existing appium server sessions to run your inspector <SEP> sort of like a Selenium IDE, but a very cut down version, still allows you to do basic record actions - better than nothing I guess <SEP> ya, i thought so :) just an opinion guys <SEP> Just want to hear your opinion -- <SEP> don't want to debate but I'm using Robot Framework (open source) + appium to manage automation scripts on mobile <SEP> Is there somekind listing of all ""good"" frameworks? <SEP> depends <SEP> ok, is there a list of possible frameworks? <SEP> no generic solution available.. since its very subjective question.. each app is different..so develop ur own.. instead of getting openion from people <SEP> - budget - which kind of application that you want to test - ect <SEP> there are some frameworks out there, Robot framework is an example, beside that, there are some more frameworks such as: cucumber <SEP> or you can even use TestNG / protractor / <SEP> I'm just trying to do presentation about test frameworks what you can use with appium <SEP> actually <SEP> Appium is designed in the theory: ""independent programming language"" <SEP> framework is just a set of rules that the man who use it should follow them <SEP> To be simple one should develop his own framework by using tools like appium <SEP> Handling the chrome browser in web application and in mobile are the both same, mean the same  ChromeDriver will it work ? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter I may be misinterpreting, but you'll have to use iOS/Android driver depending on the platform you want to test, then set your 'app' capability to the Chrome app on the device <SEP> hmm, under the hood, either web application or mobile web application will use selenium server to handle & execute event/action So the idea is they have the same 'core' even if you are performing the automation scripts on desktop browser/mobile browser But you know, the behavior in the mobile is always like is it on desktop browser! So you need to modify your scripts in order to make it works <SEP> @siggerzz , thanks for writing to me, u mean once we are able to launch the chrome, go to any website or search some thing rest of all are same as how we do with WebDriver ?? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter correct <SEP> its clear, Thanks to @minhnguyenphuonghoang  , @siggerzz <SEP> Usually in POM, we maintain the classes as per pages. in this if pages are more classes may be more, instead of this why can't we maintain the set of few classes in form of methods to cover all the functionalities of all the pages and call those methods from your tests, in this way we can reduce the number of classes and we can remember even the classes too since we have few, why we wont prefer this way ??? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter You got to think of people working on it in the future. It's easier to maintain if you have the methods for a specific page in a class dedicated to that page <SEP> @siggerzz , yes it may be crt but there is chance to have some common functionalities in more than one page assume with same id/name, in this case in POM we will write a function in all the pages to handle it, here we are missing the reuseability , is not it <SEP> You can use a 'BasePage' class <SEP> and have your pages inherit it <SEP> Then just declare all the common functionality in the BaseClass and call the method in the pages that need it","is there a list of all ""good"" frameworks?

My test script runs fine locally and I find the elements I need to interact with but when I run the same script in our ""production"" environment the WebView that I should be able to interact with is not even returned in the page source. Our production environment consists of a Selenium Hub with nodes for iOS, Android, and various browser nodes for web testing. Our iOS nodes are made up of several machines each with two appium nodes running on separate ports connected to the hub.   I compared the XML returned in the page source from both the test running locally and the test running on the hub. The test running on the hub is missing the entire XCUIElementTypeWebView section in the XML.  I spun up a hub locally and connected an iOS node just like we do in our production environment (identical node config and default capabilities) and could not reproduce the missing XCUIElementTypeWebView issue. The only difference that I can see right now between running in our production environment verse spinning up the hub locally, is that the tests are executed on a different machine than that of the node -- not sure if this matters.  Looking at the Appium doc I see this note, so maybe the connection is not being established in our production environment?   <SEP> Hi All, Is there anyone tried to automate scroll on native android context.

Summarization," <SEP> yeh it's just a GUI wrapper on top of Appium, which is why you can use it to attach onto existing appium server sessions to run your inspector <SEP> sort of like a Selenium IDE, but a very cut down version, still allows you to do basic record actions - better than nothing I guess <SEP> ya, i thought so :) just an opinion guys <SEP> Just want to hear your opinion -- <SEP> don't want to debate but I'm using Robot Framework (open source) + appium to manage automation scripts on mobile <SEP> Is there somekind listing of all ""good"" frameworks? <SEP> depends <SEP> ok, is there a list of possible frameworks? <SEP> no generic solution available.. since its very subjective question.. each app is different..so develop ur own.. instead of getting openion from people <SEP> - budget - which kind of application that you want to test - ect <SEP> there are some frameworks out there, Robot framework is an example, beside that, there are some more frameworks such as: cucumber <SEP> or you can even use TestNG / protractor / <SEP> I'm just trying to do presentation about test frameworks what you can use with appium <SEP> actually <SEP> Appium is designed in the theory: ""independent programming language"" <SEP> framework is just a set of rules that the man who use it should follow them <SEP> To be simple one should develop his own framework by using tools like appium <SEP> Handling the chrome browser in web application and in mobile are the both same, mean the same  ChromeDriver will it work ? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter I may be misinterpreting, but you'll have to use iOS/Android driver depending on the platform you want to test, then set your 'app' capability to the Chrome app on the device <SEP> hmm, under the hood, either web application or mobile web application will use selenium server to handle & execute event/action So the idea is they have the same 'core' even if you are performing the automation scripts on desktop browser/mobile browser But you know, the behavior in the mobile is always like is it on desktop browser! So you need to modify your scripts in order to make it works <SEP> @siggerzz , thanks for writing to me, u mean once we are able to launch the chrome, go to any website or search some thing rest of all are same as how we do with WebDriver ?? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter correct <SEP> its clear, Thanks to @minhnguyenphuonghoang  , @siggerzz <SEP> Usually in POM, we maintain the classes as per pages. in this if pages are more classes may be more, instead of this why can't we maintain the set of few classes in form of methods to cover all the functionalities of all the pages and call those methods from your tests, in this way we can reduce the number of classes and we can remember even the classes too since we have few, why we wont prefer this way ??? <SEP> @Neni2016_twitter You got to think of people working on it in the future. It's easier to maintain if you have the methods for a specific page in a class dedicated to that page <SEP> @siggerzz , yes it may be crt but there is chance to have some common functionalities in more than one page assume with same id/name, in this case in POM we will write a function in all the pages to handle it, here we are missing the reuseability , is not it <SEP> You can use a 'BasePage' class <SEP> and have your pages inherit it <SEP> Then just declare all the common functionality in the BaseClass and call the method in the pages that need it",is there a list of all 'good'frameworks available?

You may just google a solution <SEP> Hi everyone. I'm using webdriverio with appium to test a react native app on iOS and Android. I'm having an issue where using `setValue` on a text field will sometimes skip certain letters. My guess is that the input is sent too quickly such that some characters are lost. I've tried fiddling with a work around using `setInterval` and async/await, but I can't seem to get it to send just individual letters (`addValue` seems to just concatenate and then use `setValue` under the hood, so it has the same issue). I wonder if there is a better solution? <SEP> Hah. As always just after asking a question you find a solution yourself. `setValue` seems to work differently between iOS and Android. On iOS it appends to the input, whereas on Android it clears the input and then adds the values. Anyway this works for me on iOS: `for (let c of text) { $(""~input-field"").setValue(c); driver.pause(100) }`. <SEP> I believe I've only seen missing characters on iOS so I think my solution will be to make a platform conditional on text field inputs, adding a loop with `driver.sleep()` on iOS. Thanks for listening everyone. :D <SEP> Hm actually `driver.pause()` doesn't seem to be needed at all. The loop adds enough of a delay by itself.

Summarization," <SEP> hi to all, what about UI Testing from XCode 7 in appium? who knows? <SEP> Hi everybody, I am figuring out testing Intern NodeJS tests on mobile real devices. I just noticed a issue where with Android, Appium uses the ADB tool to determine which device I want to use, based on the ID. With iOS that's a different story, where I need to start everytime a different ios_webkit_debug_proxy and giving it the correct UUID. Is there something out there, that either makes it possible to make Appium do all the ios_webkit_debug_proxy themself, or a hub in front of it or something, that I only need to give appium the correct UUID in the capabilities, so I won't need to start everytime a new ios_webkit_debug_proxy for each device I want the test to run on ? <SEP> Basically, I want to start a test on a external machine (in the same network), and that appium does the testing on the device I specify it to in the test, without having first to start the ios_webkit_debug_proxy on the correct device beforehand. I want Appium to do this for me, just like it does with adb. <SEP> native apps dont require debug proxy <SEP> Basically, it only makes a screenshot right now using intern with nodejs. Thing is, we want it tested on multiple devices, testing serially, using a ID to connect to the proper device each test, making screenshots of various pages. <SEP> Yes, but we do not want to change that on the Appium side of the machine. If we send a test via intern with NodeJS to the appium server, Appium should be handling this, without any work before hand to link up a ios-webkit-debugger to the iOS device. So basically, when Appium gets a request to test something on a iOS device, it should link up to the specified device by running for example ios-webkit-debug-proxy to the specified device with the correct port, and start testing it. <SEP> As I noticed, Appium starts ADB and checks if the device is connected, and makes a connection to the android device on the ID that is given via intern.",UI Testing from XCode 7 in appium

On Android its working perfectly. I calculate the pixel per second i have to drop for the value i want to set. Then i grab the thumbs with TouchAction and slide it. On iOS i am not able to get the drag and drop for the thumb. The viewport of my driver.Window().Size is exactly the half of the pixels (iPhone Xr 1,792x828).  So which coordinates i have to drag and drop? The driver pixel or the real pixel? In both cases i am not able to set the slider.  Driver Slider coordinates: x~22, y=643 Real Slider Coordinates: x~45, y=1418 ``` var slider = driver.FindElementByAccessibilityId(""Slider"");             var PixelPerSecond = slider.Size.Width / GetSongDuration();              var y = slider.Location.Y;             var xLeft = slider.Location.X;             var xRight = slider.Location.X + slider.Size.Width;              foreach (var i in Enumerable.Range(0, 4))             {                 var lowerDiff = lower - GetLoopStartPosition();                 if (lowerDiff != 0)                 {                     var pixelToDragFromLeft = PixelPerSecond * lowerDiff;                      TouchAction action = new TouchAction(driver);                     action.Touch(xLeft, y);                     action.MoveTo(xLeft + Convert.ToInt32(pixelToDragFromLeft), y);                     action.Release();                     action.Perform();                                         xLeft += Convert.ToInt32(pixelToDragFromLeft);                 }                 else                 {                     break;                 }             } ```  The other problem is, that i have Time Picker (Xamarin Syncfusion SfPicker). On iOS i see the two Picker Wheels as UI elements in the visual tree. On Android i cant see them, the visual tree is basically empty although my UI elements have a AutomationId. How can interact with the hidden elements?

Is it possible to config the adb file name from adb.exe into something like xxx_adb.exe?

Summarization," <SEP> @KumarShailav_twitter Hi you can flow the same strategy like we do for appium Mac OSX. <SEP> @kavalerchik Can you just add all appium related dependencies in your pom. xml and start with appium directly. You really don't need to have a new IDE if you are already using Eclipse or IntelliJ. If you are doing for android then you can create a app folder in project directory and paste your android .apk file . Coming to your CI integration with Jenkins you can do for appium as well. It will be few more additional steps: 1. You need to write few scripts to start your appium server there 2. Secondly, You need to create emulator and launch it. 3. At last you can trigger your maven project by adding Maven step. <SEP> Anyone here using swipe or has interacted with sliders in Appium 1.8.1, This is for Android. <SEP> @kavalerchik  Oh, I thought you are testing mobile apps.

Summarization," <SEP> give me 2 min. <SEP> @LyubomirStoimchev  : So if I think I understand you want to use Appium to confirm the calendar is in french? What is it currently doing now? The only way I see to test for a locale is by setting is via desired capabilities with ""Locale"" <SEP> There's also Language as well that can be set using : language (Sim/Emu-only) Language to set for the simulator / emulator. On Android, available only on API levels 22 and below <SEP> Let's go a little bit back. I'm currently implementing a way to select a date from android build in calendar (the new one that is material design and not the one with wheels). So far so good. The emulator that I'm running the test in has English as system language but the app itself uses French(or some other non-english language). When you open the calendar while in the app, the system calendar that is opened takes the language from the app and not from the system meaning that the calendar is in French. The problem is that when the calendar is in French all the month values are in french (like ""28 aout 2000"" instead of ""28 august 2000"") and I cannot cast them to DateTime object without knowing the Locale. Yes I know I can hardcode the Locale and cast it with that value but I want to make a more general solution in which I detect the locale of the app and use it when casting the objects. <SEP> Also I have tried using the capabilities that you mentioned but the change the system language and not the app language. <SEP> @LyubomirStoimchev : Got it. Sounds like you need to get the current date locally from the device in english and then based on that search for language that should show. <SEP> you have to know the locale first, if you can't get the locale then that's a problem it sounds with the app <SEP> yep.. <SEP> Well I can select day and year without a problem, but for month I need to know the locale. Currently I'm thinking that since the calendar opens on todays date I can easily navigate and select the date that I need. But the problem is that this is an assumption and somewhere it may not open on todays date. <SEP> yep, that is the risk <SEP> ```  <SEP> As it says, install with *brew* <SEP> or it should be in path `'/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/node_modules/.bin:/Applications/Appium.app/Contents/MacOS:/Users/.../Library/Android/sdk/tools:/Users/.../Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/.../Library/Android/sdk/tools:/Users/.../Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools'` <SEP> @Asimk21 but it's already installed, locally and glabally <SEP> can you do `which carthage` ? <SEP> what is the output <SEP> ```  $npm root carhage -g /usr/local/lib/node_modules ``` so I also added this path to $PATH, and restarted Appium <SEP> It is not in path where appium looks in <SEP> `which carthage` returns nothing <SEP> so its not in path where appium looks in <SEP> how should I fixed the path <SEP> either install with brew or place carthage executable in /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin <SEP> even though I added its path to $PATH? <SEP> easiest way is `brew install carthage` <SEP> okay, will try that. thanks <SEP> After `brew install carthage`: ``` $ which carthage /usr/local/bin/carthage ``` then it works. <SEP> @Asimk21 Thank you! <SEP> and provide a little bit more code / info",is there a way to test for a locale on android?

No WEBVIEW content, e.g. ISWDP is running fine because without it I cant even launch Safari(same issue - no WEBVIEW found), and application is running using AppiumDriver manually signed  I suggest that both issues has some preconditions to run and I clearly don't understand them, official documentation doesn't helps( at least I couldn't find answer there)  could someone explain this preconditions as for a complete noob  thanx in advance <SEP> Hi All, how I can write test script to test phone dialer <SEP> using appium <SEP> could you please guide me to resolve this , <SEP> Open Application  http://localhost:4723/wd/hub  platformName=Android  platformVersion=8.1.0  deviceName=Redmi     ...    appPackage=com.android.contacts  appActivity=com.android.dialer.DialtactsActivity <SEP> I tried this way <SEP> I wanted to test the voice call, to dial a number from my script <SEP> Please help if anyone know about this? <SEP> Hi, is it possible to record (real) user-interaction with an app via appium and then just replay the sequence, when testing the app again? <SEP> @walternolak  just a suggestion: pls avoid using xpath as much as possible <SEP> Any app dev wanna give free service <SEP> @all Appium ios can run without using xcode?",how to test voice calls from robot script with appium in android/ios
