Summarization," <SEP> So I caught that bizarre problem I'd been facing. The traps worked.   My errorHandler function for the API client sends the config params to the logger, which adds log entries to the DB. I'm using the DB lib `slonik`, which has a serializer method `sql.json()`. I recently added a reference to promiseToken to the config args for API requests.  Turns out `sql.json()` rather than just serialize like JSON.stringify, it calls an internal function `deepFreeze`, which recursively calls `freeze` on whatever is passed to it.  What's a little odd, that @ShanonJackson pointed out is, freeze doesn't normally throw when attempting to re-assign a property. When I try it in node, I don't get an error, however, when I try it on the playground  <SEP> have you done any of the boxed ones? <SEP> Side opinion question - recursively mutating the object with `Object.freeze` for a serializer seems like a pretty nasty side-effect.

I'm assuming it's going to be a ""doh"" moment and I just don't know wha to search for.  Let's say you have a merchant who sells items. All possible items are known, so we represent those as an enum:  ``` enum Items {   Necklace = ""Necklace"",   GolfBall = ""GolfBall"",   Yarn = ""Yarn"", } ```  Each merchant has a subset of items, and for each of those they have a price and a variant. But let's say you're adding types to an existing project, and need to define the types for something that looks like this:  ``` const merchant = {   prices: {      <SEP> Actually, this worked:  ``` type Merchant <SEP> could have sworn I tried that first but there you have it <SEP> Is it possible to enforce TS to pick a certain overload depending on whether you're providing an anonymous function with no type information (= I want TS to do type inference), vs providing a function that already has type information (= I want to check some constraints on the function parameters).

That's brave of somebody. <SEP> see `tsc --watch` <SEP> @keithlayne we're a small company lol - https://ulayer.net if you're interested - we built our customer panel in Crystal with AmberFramework it's working out well for us <SEP> Yeah so the big caveat about experience with other statically typed languages is that TS's type system is probably different in ways that you might not expect. <SEP> how so? <SEP> Like the foundation is structural typing.  Also, TS and any type info only exist at compile time, then they are completely erased. <SEP> But generally, TS is just JS.  So the answer to many ""how do I do this in TS?"" questions is ""the same as you would in JS"". <SEP> well yeah but the compiler makes it almost certain the data type will be as expected, no? <SEP> even if the types only exist for purposes of knowing the code will work, even if not enforced at runtime <SEP> of course if the code can only flow in an expected way then typescript still does its job right <SEP> Types in most languages aren't enforced at runtime either. <SEP> not sure how LLVM handles it <SEP> Crystal compiler just turns everything into LLVM IR or something then it gets turned into native machine code <SEP> right.   All the type checking is in the compiler there too. <SEP> But importantly you can't do any reflection on the types really, and you can't generate any runtime code (with stock tsc anyway) based off your types. <SEP> What I was gonna say is that a lot of people are surprised by structural typing.  There are no exact types in TS (for now anyway). <SEP> It makes javascript a bit more readable now that I've been so used to seeing data types because of Crystal <SEP> What's important is TS is usually ""can a value of type T be assigned to this thing of type U?"".  Sometimes people are surprised by the answer. <SEP> it's weird not seeing data types in a language now <SEP> When contributing to open source Rails apps its kinda weird not knowing the data type due to a lack of annotations <SEP> Just remember inference is your friend too, I'm sure you're aware.",what is the type system of statically typed languages like TS?
Summarization," <SEP> Kind of just skimmed over the conversation but, if you have a function that is declared to return `A | B` and now you decide ""in this case I want to return `C` instead without having to declare it"", how can the compiler know that *at the call site*?  Types only exist at compile time.  So at the call site TS sees `x = foo()`, sees that `foo()` is declared to return `A | B` and typechecks accordingly.  Now at runtime it actually returns `C` and everything breaks because the typecheck did the wrong thing <SEP> BTW are you using quicktype for the JSON schema - <SEP> @fatcerberus I guess it's really easy to do by just casting, but aliases of the same object with all different types are kinda troubling to me. <SEP> btw regarding the phantom type: be careful with those.  TS doesn't *always* retain the type parameter: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#why-doesnt-type-inference-work-on-this-interface-interface-foot--- <SEP> @keithlayne no, i forgot about it and rediscovered it a few days ago. no time to test it atm, so for now using https://github.com/horiuchi/dtsgenerator <SEP> If you ask it to infer `T`, it tries to fish it out of the structure <SEP> I remember Shanon saying that changed with a recent version and breaking his stuff.

Summarization," <SEP> Yeah I feel like there have been a lot of proposals for HKT syntax but it's tough to make any of them really jive with existing syntax. <SEP> @fatcerberus I expect `UnionToIntersection <SEP> It's actually kinda weird to me - the LHS of the `extends` is parenthesized, so I assume that it's treated as not a bare type param and therefore `never` isn't short-circuited as usual, but inside the parens it *is* treated as a bare param and triggers distribution.  Hard to describe what I mean, hope that makes sense. <SEP> But re U2I I assume people are passing arbitrary unions to it and you'd think it would be quite common for some wrapped type alias to end up as `never`. <SEP> @keithlayne Yeah but like I said - if you consider `never` to be the intersection of everything (which it really is - the bottom type satisfies all other types, *ex falso quodlibet*), then the dual of that would be the union of everything - `unknown`.  What makes it weird is that it's going in the opposite direction from normal, but I've said this in the past: `UnionToIntersection` would be self-dual <SEP> It just happens that `never` is distributive <SEP> That's super interesting <SEP> * <SEP> but I think that output is basically a leaked implementation detail.

Just don't think it should be a go-to tool. <SEP> And then the inevitable question from the other end ""What does that do?"" <SEP> yeah we can do tons of things with unions, I don't really agree with that comment. <SEP> Although it would suck to have to create an explicit HKT per type if that makes sense",proposals fro HKT syntax for example the self-dual UnionToIntersection

Summarization," <SEP> It would make sense if it considered `A` atomically - but since it's a union, it doesn't (or isn't supposed to anyway), it applies the conditional to each member of the union individually <SEP> Yeah, but the same thing happened even with my number case <SEP> Oh I see - the distributive mapping only applies when the thing being checked is a type parameter <SEP> Not for concrete types <SEP> @qm3ster  ```ts type a <SEP> It only applies for generic type parameters which I didn't know <SEP> Well in that case, just this works :v ```ts type a = ""str"" | 1 | 2 type b = a & number ``` <SEP> Unfortunately, this doesn't collapse: ```ts type A = {} | { readonly v: 1 } | { readonly v: 2 } type B = A & { v:number } ``` <SEP> Right I was just pointing out how it worked since you said you didn't know what distribution was",distributive mapping doesn't apply to all members of a union
Summarization," <SEP> That's what I meant though - if you declared the array as say `""a"" | ""b""` how would typescript know it could widen that to `string` (or even `any`) for `includes` but not any for other method?  It couldn't really do that kind of thing selectively.  I know it seems intuitive for you that this should work but from the compiler's point of view you're basically asking to disable all type checking just because it's in a typeguard <SEP> Which I mean yeah could be done but it might be dangerous in practice since it would have to be an all-or-nothing thing <SEP> Unless the compiler had some kind of crazy AI smarts in it or something :smile:",how would typescript know it could widen an array to any for includes

Summarization," <SEP> Hello, I know there is a way to do what I want to do, I just don't know it...

Is there some kind of keyword I can use, or typescript function that allows me to basically set these kinds of conditional types to a function based on the data being sent to the function? <SEP> @webstrand  too bad the playground doesn't have a knob for that yet. <SEP> @demitchell14 You can do overloads, or you can use generics.  Be warned though, in the case  of a boolean, it's actually represented as `true | false`, which causes some issues. <SEP> the only way it can possibly work is if that boolean is statically `true`, i.e. passed as a literal.  If TS can only narrow it to `boolean` at compile time, there's no way you can have an effect on the return type. <SEP> To get what you want, you'll probably have to use overloads. <SEP> playground <SEP> ah, figured it out <SEP> alright, thank you.

But I feel like they don't like that. <SEP> i think it would be fine to bless known key access, validate types of indexed writes, and treat indexed reads as nullable <SEP> I think that would be better than fine :) <SEP> i don't know enough about the compiler to know how that would be implemented, but the current implementation of index signatures doesn't match reality <SEP> but since you can't do that right now AFAIK, my personal rule is to avoid it unless writing a generic array algorithm, and there's nearly zero chance I'll need to do that at this point (and I don't even wanna think about stuff like sparse arrays).

I think I was imagining something like contravariant, and munged the two together in my head <SEP> I'm not sure contravariant is correct either. I'm not sure how useful such a type would be, since `assignable(A & B) = unknown | A | B | A & B` which would reduce to just `unknown`. <SEP> Thats why I said above  <SEP> Because unknown would just subsume everything, being the top type <SEP> The trouble is, I haven't found a rationale for excluding `unknown`. I'm leery to say that it's useful, until I can exclude `unknown` for some defined reason <SEP> that's how you uncover new forms of unsoundness <SEP> Im pretty sure that if intersections were distributive, `UnionToIntersection` would be bidirectional <SEP> Because contravariance is like negation: it flips the sign <SEP> I'm a bit confused, which sign? Usually when we talk about inverting types we mean `-A` is equivalent to `  <SEP> So what does it mean to flip the co/contravariance of a type <SEP> Does it actually mean `  <SEP> Sign being metaphor for variance <SEP> e.g. function parameters are contravariant.  Parameter of higher-order function (function as parameter) is covariant because contravariant(contravariant) = covariant <SEP> Yep, I get that. But my intuition says that variance is part of an arithmetic. <SEP> (if that's even the right term, for it) <SEP> Sometimes variance is even expressed as sign.  Positive = co, negative = contra <SEP> You can only define it with respect to the containing type.  If its contravariant then the subtype relation for that type parameter varies opposite to that of the containing type <SEP> It doesnt make sense to ask what is the variance of a type <SEP> Only a type parameter <SEP> I guess I'll have to think about it, some more. My problem may be that I'm thinking about contravariance as if it were part of the type universe, when it's actually not. <SEP> Yeah, its not a property of types themselves <SEP> Its a property of a type variable <SEP> With respect to a containing type <SEP> *containing generic type <SEP> Alright, contravariance is not the term I'm looking for, at all. <SEP> btw did you know that TS distributes intersections of unions into unions of intersections <SEP> that's what I was getting at before <SEP> `(A | B) & (C | D)` becomes `(A & C) | (A & D) | ...` <SEP> Which interestingly also has the property of grouping by precedence <SEP> Just noticed that <SEP> stupid unnecessary parens <SEP> If I define `Foo","if intersections were distributive, UnionToIntersection would be bidirectional"

Lots of topics and ppl here. :) <SEP> It's got 3 main parts probably <SEP> yeah, it was a very broad question, never mind. <SEP> first you say, for each key in T, find out if it's function-valued.  If so, the output type has `never` for that key.  Otherwise you get the key name as the value. <SEP> ```ts { foo: number, bar: Function } // becomes { foo: 'foo', bar: never } ``` <SEP> @tonisostrat Ask away.. I just wasnt clear who/what your question was directed at. <SEP> Thanks @keithlayne .  Why is it necessary to append the object with  <SEP> now you apply the index `keyof T` which is `'foo' | 'bar'`, which gives you a union of all the *value types* from that object.  In this case, `'foo' | never`, which is just `'foo'`, which is a union of all the non-function valued keys. <SEP> naah, i think it's unanswerable anyway. what i was getting at is i've been a dev for close to 11 years now, i've worked on a fair number of projects, built multiple large-scale systems from scratch on my own yet i have no idea how i might stack up compared to ""talent"" from other countries. i've never thought about working for a foreign company so i've started wondering whether i'd be good enough to compete with other people there - because i know my country's talent pool is quite small and definitely not indicative of the wider world. <SEP> @tonisostrat FWIW with a few exeptions because of govt influence, I dont find that which country you are in affects avg dev quality. <SEP> In one large populous country the govt had a policy of ""go into IT, we'll pay, and you can make money"".

Summarization," <SEP> TypeScript newbie. I'm trying to store a subclass of an abstract class in a holding variable, then instantiate that subclass later. Problem is, I won't know which subclass is in the variable. I'm getting tripped up when I try to instantiate the held variable. Here's a minimal example:  ```typescript abstract class Foo {}  class Bar extends Foo {}  const holding: typeof Foo = Bar;  const fooDerived: Foo = new holding; // Cannot create an instance of an abstract class. ``` <SEP> What is the proper way to go about doing something of this effect? <SEP> You could let typescript infer the type: ```ts const holding = Bar; ``` Otherwise ```ts const holding: typeof Bar = Bar; ``` <SEP> unless you need `holding` to store an *arbitrary* subclass of Foo? <SEP> ^ Exactly this. <SEP> then, you may have luck with this: ```ts abstract class Foo { } type FooSubclass = typeof Foo & {     new (): Foo; }  class Bar extends Foo {}  class Baz extends Foo {     constructor(_: string) { super() } }  const holding1: FooSubclass = Bar; const holding2: FooSubclass = Baz; // produces error: this will need a different solution  const fooDerived: Foo = new holding1; ``` <SEP> Yep, that should work. All my subclasses have the same constructor sig. Thank you! <SEP> Back again with an another question.

So the answer to many ""how do I do this in TS?"" questions is ""the same as you would in JS"". <SEP> well yeah but the compiler makes it almost certain the data type will be as expected, no? <SEP> even if the types only exist for purposes of knowing the code will work, even if not enforced at runtime <SEP> of course if the code can only flow in an expected way then typescript still does its job right <SEP> Types in most languages aren't enforced at runtime either. <SEP> not sure how LLVM handles it <SEP> Crystal compiler just turns everything into LLVM IR or something then it gets turned into native machine code <SEP> right.   All the type checking is in the compiler there too. <SEP> But importantly you can't do any reflection on the types really, and you can't generate any runtime code (with stock tsc anyway) based off your types. <SEP> What I was gonna say is that a lot of people are surprised by structural typing.  There are no exact types in TS (for now anyway). <SEP> It makes javascript a bit more readable now that I've been so used to seeing data types because of Crystal <SEP> What's important is TS is usually ""can a value of type T be assigned to this thing of type U?"".  Sometimes people are surprised by the answer. <SEP> it's weird not seeing data types in a language now <SEP> When contributing to open source Rails apps its kinda weird not knowing the data type due to a lack of annotations <SEP> Just remember inference is your friend too, I'm sure you're aware.",what is the type system of statically typed languages like TS?

Maybe in our case it won't be necessary.   Otherwise, should types generated for different module formats be the same? <SEP> The black and white behavior isnt bad, but I suspect it prevents them from implementing warnings that might be nice to have... since they would break your build by definition <SEP> `noUnusedParameters` would be more useful if it wasnt a build-breaking error <SEP> tsc still emits but returns a nonzero error code so other tools in the chain think it failed <SEP> they could extend the tsconfig format to support warnings pretty easily I think, would be non-breaking. <SEP> practically speaking though, you can delegate those checks to a linter.  Probably get booed by @AnyhowStep. <SEP> Boo <SEP> Linters suck at the moment because we're missing the type relationship API <SEP> the fact that it will exit non-zero but still emit by default can be confusing as well.",should types be the same for different module formats?

What do you do to debug? <SEP> Loaded question I know.. just wondering if there's something big that helps, that I've never heard of @DanielRosenwasser <SEP> 1. TypeScript supports sourcemaps, which allow you to trace your emit back to your original TypeScript source 2.

I can work around it by creating a wrapper typescript file that does `const testModule = require(""../build/Release/test-module"")` and then wrap everything the module provides, but that seems incorrect.

Summarization," <SEP> I just think it's a design limitation, TypeScript isn't able to represent that.

I'll experiment. <SEP> I somehow thought it did. <SEP> I think you misunderstand - it can represent the overloads as a *type* perfectly fine.  What I mean is it has no way to represent, *in literal form*, a function expression with overloads <SEP> Because once it's out of literal form and just a variable, all bets are off <SEP> Like, conceptually what you're doing is declaring this permissive arrow function and then attaching overloads to it after the fact - so it can't use those for type checking <SEP> Am I explaining that well? <SEP> OK, I can see that the argument of fooOrBar on the third-last line of the original code would be non-denotable if it was inferred from the type that the function was being assigned to. <SEP> But I was hoping it would be inferred anyway :) <SEP> I think what we'd need to make this work is some kind of better contextual typing - where TS could see you're assigning the function literal to a function type with overloads and have those contribute to type checking the literal itself <SEP> It's theoretically possible, we even have this kind of context-sensitive typing for a lot of things (how it infers parameter types for inline callbacks e.g.), but it doesn't do that for function expressions to my knowledge <SEP> Although I get what you're talking about now, I did anyway just double-check that function parameters **are** normally inferred when assigning to a simple function type. <SEP> It seems to just be when assigning to an overloaded function type that it isn't inferred - maybe that's because it's un-denotable, so it just says ""sod it, I guess that's `any`"". <SEP> Yeah, like I said, it's possible *in theory*; I don't know how much work it would be to implement in practice though.

The check has to be at runtime, when the type is erased. <SEP> Effectively T is a universal quantifier <SEP> You need an alternate channel (like a string arg) to communicate the check type at runtime <SEP> An `isNullable` type predicate doesn't make much sense. <SEP> could you explain? <SEP> What does your `Foo <SEP> If you take an `unknown` as input it is definitely nullable. <SEP> @keithlayne Basically he wants a function that, given `T = string` returns true if the arg is `Foo <SEP> If its say `Foo <SEP> Which is tricky <SEP> sorry, was distracted <SEP> @AnyhowStep I have `export interface Foo <SEP> I think it will depend a great deal on the implementation of `Foo` tbh <SEP> I want to guard that a value from a responses payload is of type `Foo <SEP> *response <SEP> you could do a type lookup by value <SEP> For some specific `T`, am I correct in that assessment <SEP> @fatcerberus exactly <SEP> Yeah thats tricky because of the type erasure <SEP> @keithlayne what do you mean by a type lookup by value? <SEP> At runtime you only have a `Foo`, the generic is completely erased <SEP> @fatcerberus I'd expect this to be a common problem, so that it isn't indicates to me I'm doing something wrong <SEP> at least it seems to indicate so <SEP> I could write type guards for each possible T but that seems unnecessarily repetitive <SEP> Basically you need to do two checks: is this thing a Foo?

Summarization," <SEP> I'd consider Opaleye one: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/opaleye <SEP> OK, baby done eating, so a slightly better example, perhaps. Had a business case where there were several domain objects of various types stored in a DB.  There was a user permissions / capabilities system as well.  We were able to implement the permissions system's semantics in an domain-object-agnostic fashion, which would involve a series of joins and filters.  This implementation would apply to any query (partially constructed or complete) to achieve the desired restrictions.  Further, we could require that direct table access to the domain object tables (if desired) could only be achieved via an application of the permissions system.  The end result of this is that queries could be built up in smaller, semantically meaningful pieces, the results of which could then be fed through the higher-order permissions system, which would produce a transformed query which was still highly efficient, but had the correct access restrictions applied to it.    Constructing those types of queries in raw sql, by hand, for each underlying query or operation which supported the business functionality would have been extremely expensive and highly error prone, almost certain to be wrong in some places. <SEP> Might be hard to visualize without concrete details that i can't provide, but hopefully gives a little more flavor",implementing a 'permissions-agnostic' semantics framework

I'm super new in TypeScript and after 6 hours of surfing google and documentation came here as I have no more power to get clear answer and solution.  ` interface getKeys_object {     source:object;     keys:string <SEP> You must not have strict null checks on, because the one you say is OK is implicitly any because `getKeys_keys | getKeys_object` has no index signature.  So its not OK. <SEP> Otherwise your error message is straightforward. <SEP> If you are using i.e. vscode you can hover over those variables and see what types TS has inferred for them, which is the union. <SEP> Also you dont need that type annotation in your function. <SEP> So all of this works fine: ```ts interface getKeys_object {   source: object   keys: string <SEP> You could also overload your function so that TS knows the return type when you only have one argument.  Not sure its worth it though. <SEP> To do that, just add these lines before the function definition: ```ts function getKeys(source: object): getKeys_keys function getKeys(source: object, only: boolean): getKeys_keys | getKeys_object ``` ...then you wouldnt need the type guard on `outputKeys`. <SEP> Thank you HUGE @keithlayne  Yeah I'm doing TS self learning in VS and WebStorm in parallel to see which one gives better results haha Looks adding  TypeScript to my vanilla js with JSDoc life will makes everything more clear and smart. Thank you again for solution and tips and especially last one which looks strange due function repeat :D <SEP> Yeah those are just function signatures, in your case the original implementation would not change, and would still be included as-is in addition to these lines. <SEP> The TS docs are not good, but apparently a long-term project is trying to address that.

Summarization," <SEP> This may be is a bizarre question. But still, I am want to get some opinions on it.  From Typescript 2.9.2, one can use the `import` keyword as a way to find the type of a module. For example  ``` function getUser (): typeof import('./Models/User').default {   return //   } ```  This works great. But using it generic cannot work, since `import` is not a type or an interface  ``` // Not a valid syntax function getModel <SEP> Isn't there an import type in 3.8 <SEP> https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html#type-only-imports-and-export <SEP> Seems like it would be cleaner (and work) <SEP> I believe, `import` is a keyword. The example you shared shows, how to import just types from a module <SEP> and not the implementation <SEP> Hm isn't that what you're trying to do? <SEP> ``` function getModel <SEP> Seems like a type to me <SEP> Okay, maybe I missing something, Can you tell me, how about tweaking my code to make it work? <SEP> Or something <SEP> `Import` is not a type exported by the `User` model <SEP> I want a function to accept a string (which is the module path) and return type of that module. <SEP> Actually even that makes no sense <SEP> Actually what it makes no sense <SEP> so, say, your module abcd has export class X {}, you want `getModel('abcd')` to have a return type X? <SEP> Yes <SEP> Using `typeof import('module')` as a type, returns the type.

How can I remove this warning without changing the compiler settings to be less strict? <SEP> @ryanewtaylor maybe just `import 'core-js'` <SEP> That was it.

Summarization," <SEP> @NaridaL thank you very much! Reflect design keys for typescript is not documented anywhere? desigh:returntype etc <SEP> Those are defined by reflect-metadata which isn't part of typescript but a general proposal. <SEP> https://rbuckton.github.io/reflect-metadata/ <SEP> And `    console.log(Reflect.getMetadataKeys(clazz, methodName));` will tell you what's available anyways. <SEP> I'm actually fascinated <SEP> So they want to add types to JS I know it <SEP> But I didn't know it gone that far into types <SEP> See also https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/2589 for more details <SEP> thanks @westonpace <SEP> @idchlife Check this out :D https://www.npmjs.com/package/runtime-type-checks <SEP> Yeah, idea is nice but package as I see is outdated <SEP> Working runtime type checks exist for FlowType <SEP> But they were buggy year ago <SEP> Like it could've changed your scope or did not add scope at all etc <SEP> Basically making it not usable <SEP> https://github.com/pleerock/class-validator  there this and other libraries from @pleerock they can give injections, type checks etc <SEP> But basically runtime type checks for typescript are as good as dead <SEP> And I don't actually know is it for better or worse <SEP> proposals and issues are raised several times every year <SEP> but they die because TS have different philosophy. <SEP> I'm wondering why not add like separate dev team for this case.

Summarization," <SEP> usually you publish the types alongside the JS in an npm package.

Summarization," <SEP> I dont understand why that fixes it but good that you got it fixed :smiley: <SEP> Thats a much more sane build time <SEP> @LuisAverhoff I think there's probably some disconnect somewhere, allowing typescript to infer the generic type of `ContentList` resolves the issue: https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-ts-rm9e6f <SEP> @kungfooman it looks like you have no-implicit-any turned on. The `lol` property is picked up because of declaration merging, but you'll need to define types for the functions at the functions, something like this should work: ```ts /**  * @param {any} type  * @param {any} time   * @param {any} value   */ function AnimationKeyable(type, time, value) {     this.init(type, time, value) }  /**  * @param {any} type  * @param {any} time  * @param {any} value  */ AnimationKeyable.prototype.init = function (type, time, value) {     // Todo } ``` <SEP> @SalathielGenese I think your decorator issue might be a TS bug/limitation. Even setting `target` to be the nonsensical `number` allows compilation to complete without errors. <SEP> @fatcerberus There was an open pull request, so I had to implement those changes manually and force webpack to use that version of the loader instead of the one installed from NPM. The core issue was that webpack loaders are _supposed_ to be stateless, which meant that the loader had to re-create the typescript program for each file being linted - because by convention they weren't supposed to share the program between calls.  That's dumb, and expensive. The first iteration of the solution was to cache the program in the webpack instance. This broke linting with webpack --watch, which is really important for dev builds. It caused the first linting results to get reported over and over again. The fix for that was to cache the program per webpack instance, with a plugin that listens for the ""done"" event and clears that cache. <SEP> Thanks you for have taken a look @Gerrit0. I think I will be forced to set time to look at TypeScript compiler and play with it until I know how to add features to it. <SEP> @SalathielGenese I also spent some time trying to make the writable check work... doesn't look like it's possible.  ```ts type WithReadonly = { readonly prop: string } type WithoutReadonly = { prop: string } type Result = WithReadonly extends WithoutReadonly ? true : false // = <SEP> Actually, nevermind <SEP> I should have googled first",typescript inference of ContentList doesn't seem to work

A nested dependency tree means that your dependencies can have their own dependencies which can have their own, and so on. This is really great on the server where you don't have to care much about space and latency. It lets you not have to care about dependency conflicts as all your dependencies use e.g. their own version of Underscore. This obviously doesn't work that well on the front-end. Imagine a site having to download three copies of jQuery.

Summarization," <SEP> I feel like I'm losing my mind here, can anyone explain the steps to add a very basic definition file?

So what's the critical piece there? How would I adapt that to a real use case? <SEP> huh, so it looks like taking out the `files` config and running `tsc main.ts` doesn't work again <SEP> reading over what you wrote, the issue is probably: `yarn tsc test.ts` You need to build the entire project, instead. <SEP> Hmmm, okay <SEP> looks like, if you want to compile individual files, just do: `yarn tsc main.ts global.d.ts` which works without anything in tsconfig.json <SEP> That helps narrow down the problem! My actual use case is that I want to declare Sinon as a global for Mocha so I don't have to include it every time. I'm using `ts-node/register` and trying to reference the definition file, so maybe it's not being included... <SEP> Thanks so much for the help! I'm gonna look over the documentation again now that I can assume that that the problem is the definition file not being loaded. :) <SEP> I'm pretty new to all of this so I had no idea what was going wrong as was getting frustrated. <SEP> So it turns out you have to specify the project file with `ts-node`, have to add a parameter for it to actually read from `files` and `include` and also have to remove all the comments from the JSON for it to work haha <SEP> I wish the JSON spec allowed comments. It's basically useless for anything but interchange without them. <SEP> Thanks @fatcerberus , that was definitely throwing me off.

Summarization," <SEP> @cbier It's for describing when a function can be used as a constructor function <SEP> So you might have code like this, right? `let animal = new Animal(""Goat"");` <SEP> ah <SEP> Say you're writing `interface Animal` which describes an already existing JS library <SEP> You'd use a construct signature to let TS know that that is a valid usage of `Animal` <SEP> Thanks Jason <SEP> that makes a lot of sense <SEP> do you know of any documentation on the 'new' keyword in this context? <SEP> @cbier The handbook is probably a good bet, this section looks like the right topic to me: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook/blob/master/pages/Interfaces.md#difference-between-the-static-and-instance-sides-of-classes <SEP> But I think that might be what you're already looking at? <SEP> yeah that's exactly where I am at <SEP> `new` was never explained in the context of an interface, so that's where the confusion came in for me. <SEP> I just want more information on it and to understand it better, but your explanation was enough for now <SEP> That's because the only place they show up is at construct signatures, and that's the topic of the section :) <SEP> @DanielRosenwasser thanks for chiming in <SEP> I guess it was most confusing for me because `new` is usually used in the context of creating a new instance of a class <SEP> gotcha <SEP> if you have any ways to clarify the documentation, feel free to file an issue at https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Handbook <SEP> if the interface looked like this: ``` interface ClockConstructor {     constructor (hour: number, minute: number); } ``` I would have immediately grasped it <SEP> but who am I to change the syntax of a language lol <SEP> thanks @DanielRosenwasser <SEP> I really appreciate all of the work you are doing in the community. <SEP> on second thought now, `new` makes sense because the constructor is the function that gets called when you create a `new` instance of a class <SEP> maybe that was the intention? <SEP> I think it was more to reflect call signatures, which look like `(a,b,c): d` <SEP> And I guess we could have made call signatures `function (a,b,c): d`, but that reads a little awkwardly <SEP> call signatures === function types, right? <SEP> Yeah, anything that can be called should have call signatures <SEP> Also, if you want to get into the nitty-gritty, `constructor` actually ends up being a method on your instances when you `new` up a class <SEP> so it would be harder to describe that scenario <SEP> that is because in the JS the ""constructor function"" is a self-executing function that returns the class constructor, right? <SEP> that is how the constructor ends up being a method on your instances <SEP> if I am following you <SEP> sorry, going on a rabbit trail <SEP> `return Greeter` being the part where the constructor is tacked onto the instance <SEP> you're talking about in TS world, and I jumped out to the compiled JS. sorry for being confusing <SEP> @cbier doing that would make the return type an object as it is explicit, will raise it as a bug <SEP> someone can always tell me it isnt",documentation on using 'new'as a constructor function in typescript?

Summarization," <SEP> HI all, Im very new to typescript and Im trying to move my js code to TS but havent been able to get an answer to what seems like a pretty simple question. Sorry in advance if its a dumb mistake.   Why do I keep getting the following error:  <SEP> can you programmatically export values in type script <SEP> something like <SEP>   exports <SEP> Nope, that's not supported since it would be basically impossible to type. <SEP> @rmartin-carecloud your constructor for `ClientCreator` is `constructor(public serviceBaseUrl: any, public route: any)` - two arguments. But in `searchAllergy` you only provide one. `new ClientCreator({ serviceBaseUrl: baseUrl, route: allergen })`. I'm guessing that your `ClientCreator` class should mirror the commented out version, like this: ```ts export class ClientCreator {     client: any     serviceBaseUrl: string     route: string      constructor({ serviceBaseUrl, route }: { serviceBaseUrl: string, route: string }) {         this.serviceBaseUrl = serviceBaseUrl         this.route = route         this.client = axios.create({ baseURL: `${serviceBaseUrl}/${route}/`, headers: { accept: ""application/json"" } })     } } ``` <SEP> There are some enums I'm having trouble accessing in a package that I'm using. The enum is defined in a @types declaration as follows: <SEP> ``` declare module AI {     enum SeverityLevel {         Verbose = 0,         Information = 1,         Warning = 2,         Error = 3,         Critical = 4,     }      ...... } ``` <SEP> But I've only been able to successfully import the following module: <SEP> ``` declare module 'applicationinsights-js' {     const AppInsights: Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.IAppInsights;     const Util: typeof Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.UtilHelpers; } ``` <SEP> I need the `SeverityLevel` enum to use for arguments to some of the methods provided by the library, but I've been unable to find a way to import them. <SEP> I can't imagine that I must redefine the enum myself. <SEP> is there a way, with tsserver, to get the full specification of a type? <SEP> `quickinfo` seems to truncate some stuff, sometimes <SEP> Thanks @Gerrit0 I really appreciate it! That helped a lot.",can you programmatically export values in type script ?
Summarization," <SEP> ^ this is pretty much the reason T extends Test doesn't mean T equals Test, it means T atleast equals Test but could be a superset of Test what should Partial <SEP> Got it. Given that, is there any expression that can satisfy `Partial <SEP> @ebroder the comment on that ticket is the key, there are types that extend `Test` that dont include `{ x: ""foo  <SEP> Which you can see because: <SEP> ```ts interface Bar extends Test {   x: 'bar' } ``` doesnt cause an error on `extends`. <SEP> Hmm.

If that makes sense. <SEP> Well, *I* don't agree with the compiler. :wink:  For example, this typechecks but it really shouldn't: ```ts interface Test {   x: string }; interface EvilTest extends Test {   x: 'quux' } function test <SEP> Now we have an EvilTest object which deviates from its type signature and the compiler just whistles and looks the other way <SEP> Now imagine if instead of a string vs. a string literal, it's `number | string` vs. just `string` <SEP> what happens if you return T after you set x? <SEP> Assuming you meant like below, yeah, it still checks out: ```ts interface Test {   x: string }; interface EvilTest extends Test {   x: 'quux' } function test <SEP> I think we found a loophole in the type checker <SEP> You can redefine a property to be more specific in a subclass but the compiler won't necessarily honor it <SEP> At least if generics are involved anyway <SEP> Yeah, I just tried it too. With explicit return type too. <SEP> With `readonly` though you really shouldnt even be able to set fields of `X` when `T extends X`.  Which would be incredibly painful and restrictive to apply. <SEP> The type system isn't *always* sound, it just tries to make a best effort to prevent mistakes without getting in your way <SEP> Well, `EvilTest` *has* to be considered a bug, no fanciness really, you just totally subverted the type system without even casting. <SEP> Yeah, true <SEP> Id be fine with a note that ",is there any expression that can satisfy Partial ebroder>?

Is this the place to ask? <SEP> AFAIK, the TS team choose the term ambient to describe that the TypeScript type system is ambient to the actual JavaScript. <SEP> Thus the `declare *` is an `ambient definition` (to the JavaScript) <SEP> Yeah, it is called ""ambient"" because the actual concrete thing it's describing does not exist in your project, but will be present in the environment at runtime. <SEP> @crs117 I dont see why not, though Im pretty new here as well. Im getting schooled on language semantics right now <SEP> So you are declaring that this thing, while you don't have a concrete implementation in your project, will exist ambiently at runtime <SEP> ""abmient"" here having the dictionary definition of ""existing or present around you"" <SEP>  will exist ambiently at runtime  I think it is at dev-time, not runtime.

But I dont think they have support for running on my CI server <SEP> https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-typescript/blob/master/generating-aurelia-type-definitions.md that is so weird <SEP> why not just make the source files .ts files? <SEP> @ryanwischkaemper what I'd like to do is to convert .js into .ts using existing type information from a .d.ts file. I'm not sure if I understand what's going on with aurelia, but it looks like they're writing TS in .js files... <SEP> @slikts They are using features from Babel to generate type definitions files (`.d.ts`) from their `.js` source code <SEP> @jbrantly I believe its because they didn't want to alienate anyone who is not familiar with Typescript <SEP> But then they have code like: https://github.com/aurelia/framework/blob/master/src/aurelia.js#L52 <SEP> just seems weird <SEP> while at the same time still fully supporting Typescript users by having all of their `.d.ts` files always up to date because they are generated from their `.js` source code <SEP> I don't get it either, that's clearly TS but in a .js file, and skimming the wiki article doesn't really clarify the reasoning to me <SEP> right <SEP> I'll find what the creator said about it <SEP> @slikts Regarding your thing, I'm not aware of any such tool. My guess is that the reasoning is any time spent creating the `.d.ts` manually in the first place could instead just be used on converting the JS to TS <SEP> @jbrantly the reason I ask is because of 3rd party type definitions in DefinitelyTyped. it would make it easier for projects to switch to TS if they could just apply the .d.ts files to their code <SEP> It doesnt let me link directly to a comment, but if you look in the comments  <SEP> Gotcha. I'm not aware of any such tool but that doesn't really mean anything. I suspect it would be quite tricky to write and error-prone though. There's lots of ways to do things in JS  that could make matching between the DTS and the JS difficult. <SEP> @ryanwischkaemper right, what I didn't realise was that babel supports the type annotations. that's kind of weird. <SEP> It does because of Flow <SEP> well, partially because of Flow <SEP> @jbrantly I wonder if it's not a good idea for people who are authoring the .d.ts files to actually just convert the projects to .ts and generate the type definitions <SEP> Read that comment on the post I linked. It sounds like Babel supports it because Types in Javascript might become a standard in the future <SEP> thanks, this is actually a neat approach. I'm not sure about the support in editors, though. for instance, I use atom-typescript, and I think it only works with .ts files <SEP> V8 already has a strong mode where they are looking at introducing run-time typings: https://developers.google.com/v8/experiments <SEP> Flow supports types in .JS files, but you have to run a build step to strip the types to use the JS (basically the same as TS). Facebook used `jstransform` to do that. But they've deprecated jstransform in favor of Babel (to do JSX conversion and to strip type information). Babel was also aqui-hired by Facebook. So yea, that's (partially) why Babel supports types :D <SEP> seems like things are looking up for people who like static typing <SEP> too bad v8 is lagging so much with its support for es6, though <SEP> In what parts?

But on the other hand you dont necessarily want it only counting newly created types either since thats dependent on the surrounding code (locally nondeterminisic)... its a tricky problem <SEP> Which is why its fine in your case probably... the 14m instantiations you hit must be mostly duplicate requests that dont need to create a type <SEP> If you want to resolve a more complex type, get a better computer",why do we have tests written for recursive conditional types?

Summarization," <SEP> Hi everyone !  I'd need some advice / help on this issue. I want to know if it is possible to make class instances generics be persistent. I'd like to have my `storeTest` variable retain its type generics over subsequent calls of the `addString` method, without directly chaining the calls on one line / expression.

You can _narrow_ that type, but you cannot _expand_ that type. <SEP> Also, what you are doing isn't expanding the type, you are _changing_ the type. <SEP> Thanks to both of you. What i imagined, since the javascript variable stores the instance and its internal changes, would be that the type of the variable could also change in consequence if necessary. <SEP> I think that's arguable: `never | T` is `T`.  You *could* look at that either way.  But I don't think it's important. <SEP> types are static and only exist at compile time. <SEP> TypeScript isn't smart enough to recognize that the generic type of your class instance is mutating as you call these methods on it.  :) <SEP> I don't know if that would be sound even if it were smart enough. <SEP> Yeah, that's what i figured. But would it make sense that TypeScript implements this in the future ? <SEP> I'm calling a method to permanently change the internal state of the instance, that wouldn't be unreasonable to be able to alter its type generics accordingly, to reflect the changed state of it ? <SEP> Depends on if it's unsound.  If so, it *should* never happen. <SEP> Unsound according to ? type theory ? <SEP> Yeah. <SEP> for now it's easy to chain all calls and reuse the resulting type somewehere else. ty for the help <SEP> But in general that method call happens at runtime, and so it can't have any impact on the type unless it can be statically analyzed. <SEP> Yeah i understand this part, and i think it can be statically analyzed, since i'm specifically giving tsc the information it needs to have an impact on it. It does a lot more complicated things related to control flow analysis. <SEP> @medfreeman You aren't actually giving enough information for that. <SEP> How so ? <SEP> You are telling the compiler, ""I'll return a thing of type `StoreTest <SEP> In this particular case, you can read the code and see that `this` specifically is returned, but one can imagine a situation where it is less obvious that `this` is returned. <SEP> You would need to make it so the return type can specify that you are returning `this`. <SEP> Is this expressible in ts ? <SEP> I don't believe there is a way to tell the compiler (currently) that the return value is `this` and it is (now) of type `...`. <SEP> yeah, without a method call even.  All that method does is cast. <SEP> (I'm assuming their real code does something else in that function) <SEP> the dangers of small reproductions <SEP> sure, it's just a contrived short example. I'm typing a js library (json-api-serializer) and try to have the types retain specific options passed as js arguments, for them to influence the response type of other methods depending on it. <SEP> The closest thing currently in the compiler is guard functions where you can do: ```typescript function isFoo(maybe: string): maybe is 'foo' { return maybe === 'foo' } ``` <SEP> This will result in code elsewhere that does `isFoo(myString)` correctly narrowing to type `'foo'` if that function returns true. <SEP> ugh your hands are pretty much tied in that case <SEP> Yeah i use custom type guards in specific cases, like asserting that an json schema object is of corresponding typescript type (automatically generated by a json schema -- <SEP> So useful <SEP> You might also have to protect from a user passing a dynamic string into the method, at that point `T` becomes `string` forever, which probably isn't too useful. <SEP> Exactly. I also battled a lot against type widening to keep string literal types instead of the primitive `string` types. <SEP> while doing conditional types and inference. i'm probably better rewriting the library from scratch ^^ <SEP> which is totally legit in JS <SEP> Yeah that's what I keep coming back to.

Not while TS doesn't have official support. <SEP> For example, https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32442 <SEP> This issue was created because having conditional types and intersections appearing in parameter lists breaks stuff in weird ways <SEP> Also this, https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32540  The best use of the `CompilerError` type I've been playing with is with generic callback functions. You check the return type satisfies a condition and cause an error if it doesn't.  However... TS **hates it** when you try to check the return type of a generic callback function in a parameter list <SEP> I **think** finally found a way to do it without breaking TS.  However, doing it requires adding intersection types in parameter lists. And that makes `F`  not assignable to `F`, even though they have the exact same signature. <SEP> If you never need to assign one generic function to another, I guess it's okay. <SEP> Not many people need to do that, I think.

Summarization," <SEP> Hello everyone, I'm not sure this is a bug or not, but I thought I'd ask here before reporting it in Github. <SEP> I'm loosely considering this a bug, but I can venture a guess that this is a feature that has not been implemented yet. If the latter is true, is there a planned release date for removing this restriction?  **TypeScript Version:**  2.0.3  **Code**  ```ts type Types = 'A' | 'B';  let typeA: Types = 'A'; // Works fine let typeB: Types = 'b'.toUpperCase(); // Compile error ```  **Expected behavior:**  TypeScript should be able to distinguish the results of a basic string operation and determine if the result matches the defined string literal type. This makes writing APIs that have to do some kind of conversion seemingly impossible if we also want a restrict the values to a subset of string literals.  **Actual behavior:**   Compile error seems to convert the value of any string operation to the generic type `string` and not the the literal result of the operation. Here's the below error:  ``` Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'Types'. ``` <SEP> Any assistance in the above would be greatly appreciated, and thanks for building such an amazing product :) <SEP> @cerebrl  That's a slippery slope should this also be valid? ``` var typeA: Types = 'astring'.substr(0,1).toUpperCase(); ``` <SEP> I'm not sure what your use-case is. These are string **litertal** types.  Under what circumstances would you prefer to write 'b'.toUpperCase() vs 'B' <SEP> @dtabuenc: Perfect, thanks <SEP> What is the idiomatic way to declare these? Should I be putting the `interface` declarations in a separate file like some kind of `actions.d.ts`?  ``` export interface IActionTypes {     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_REQUESTED: string;     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS: string;     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_FAILED: string; } export const actionTypes: IActionTypes = {     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_REQUESTED: ""customers/FETCH_CUSTOMERS_REQUESTED"",     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS: ""customers/FETCH_CUSTOMERS_SUCCESS"",     FETCH_CUSTOMERS_FAILED: ""customers/FETCH_CUSTOMERS_FAILED"", };   export interface IFetchCustomersRequested extends Redux.Action { } export interface IFetchCustomersSuccess extends Redux.Action { customers: models.ICustomer <SEP> @dtabuenc My use case is I'm given the lowercase version from one source and a second source expects it to be uppercase. I don't have the ability to change either, so our layer acts as a middleman needing to convert the value. <SEP> I understand not all string methods should be ""allowed"" in this particular case, but something as simple as toUpperCase or toLowerCase is fairly straight forward <SEP> A say ""simple"" being totally ignorant in the amount of work it takes to develop these features in TypeScript, but simple just meaning relative to other string methods. <SEP> But in order to convert you won't be able to use a literal. You have to use a variable. So you'll have to do type assertion of some sort or your type guards. <SEP>  type assertion  Not sure what you mean <SEP> you mean type casting? <SEP> technically it's not called casting because it's not run-time. <SEP> but yeah casting. <SEP> ah, didn't know that <SEP> Do you have an exmaple of how you would expect it to work in practice? <SEP> and by type guards, you just mean a conditional that checks for lowercase and does a toUpperCase on it if true? <SEP> Yeah, let me see if I can simplify a more realistic example <SEP> That would really help. I think you *might* find that what you are asking for won't really work in a real situation. <SEP> wihout  a type assertion <SEP> Okay, thanks for you help, Daniel! I'll try to get a more realistic example shortly <SEP> @cerebrl  ```  type UpperTypes = 'A' | 'B'; type LowerTypes = 'a' | 'b'  function callThatTakesCaps(arg1: UpperTypes){  }  var  lowerCase: LowerTypes = 'a';  callThatTakesCaps(lowerCase.toUpperCase() as UpperTypes);  ``` <SEP> Oh, that's nice :) <SEP> It's just that typescript can't make that automaticc inference from Lower to Upper. I think that would be difficult to implement and not worth it. <SEP> That's pretty much exactly what I needed. Thanks @dtabuenc. You're amazing!! <SEP>   I think that would be difficult to implement and not worth it.  Sure, I can see that. I'm sure my case is quite rare. <SEP> Considering your solution is sound and efficient, there's no need <SEP> @soelinn We do in certain instances. We have a rule to declare interfaces within the file in which it's used if that's the only place it's needed. But, once the definition is required outside of that file, then we pull it out into a `.d.ts` file in a dedicated definitions directory.  But, if we are developing a module to be used by third parties, we always include it in our public interface definitions directory and reference them in our docs. `export`ing those definitions as well, in case other TS users need them. <SEP> So, this is an application with internal modules? When I said modules, I meant like NPM modules. Sorry if that was confusing <SEP> If this is an application, I'd just put the definition files closest to its use. <SEP> okay, yeah, so just put the definition files as siblings to the files that use them <SEP> yes <SEP> but once module A and B use it, then pull it out into a global ""definitions"" directory <SEP> yes",is there a planned release date for removing the 'compile error' restriction?

Do you know of a plugin (such as merge) which would **only** match the preferred file? <SEP> e.g. if I had entry.ts and entry.web.ts, it would **only** match entry.web.ts, but still match other .ts files where there isn't a conflict? <SEP> Well, in gulp, you do things in pipes - so first step, load the files you want... gulp.src('src/**/*.ts')  and second step, compile them... .pipe(ts({     noImplicitAny: true,     out: 'output.js' }))  and then third step, output them... .pipe(gulp.dest('built/local')); <SEP> So I imagine you could figure out a way to do what you want... <SEP> (this is just using gulp-typescript) <SEP> Yeah.. ideally I'd merge the streams into one so tsc can do its static analysis <SEP> Interesting challenge though - any reason why you have 2 ts files for some things? <SEP> Sharing code between React for Web and React Native <SEP> basically you have `.ts` = <SEP> Need to require different files/modules based on the platform sometimes <SEP> and can't do it with dynamic requires <SEP> So you just want to deal with it in the compile stage... have 2 different build configs, one that ignores/replaces certain files with their web/native counterparts <SEP> There will be a way to do that in Gulp, I'm sure <SEP> I, however, just started using it yesterday, so I'm unsure of what exactly :P <SEP> Yeah.. I'm hoping so.. or I might have to write my own plugin <SEP> It's really just for the static analysis <SEP> so that TS will check both paths",is there any way to prefer a certain extension over another with typescript?
Summarization," <SEP> the typed command like Derived (in your example) is needed to group multiple commands with the same behavior (execute) <SEP> What is the purpose of multiple commands with the same behaviour? <SEP> (And I want to check - by 'typed', you mean 'written', not that it has types right?) <SEP> @TomSputz Same behaviour means that they behave exactly the same, but with different context. <SEP> For example, I'm creating as many RemoveCommands as many lines I have in a list, therefore each of the line can be deleted, but how I do the deletetion, is the same, just the context is different <SEP> Right, so a class ``` class Command {   execute() {     throw new Error(""Unmodified"")   } } class Derived extends Command {   tolog = ""unset""   execute() {     console.log(this.tolog)   } } const a = new Derived() const b = new Derived() a.execute() // unset b.execute() // unset b.tolog = 66 a.execute() // unset b.execute() // 66 ``` <SEP> in this example, you cannot create a Command on the file with overridden execute <SEP> and I need that ability <SEP> so I cannot only rely on the Derived class, and create an instance of those <SEP> I would like to create a command on the fly, like: const command1 = new Command(); command1.execute = () = <SEP> But.. that works fine :/ <SEP> my ts lint says that it's not, because i'm trying to override a method, and it should be a property <SEP> Well yeah, its bad practice <SEP> so tslint is telling you that it is",the typed command is needed to group multiple commands with the same behavior (execute)

Summarization," <SEP> are there multiple instances of these classes at runtime? <SEP> nope <SEP> yeah so I really don't think there's much point to singleton classes in JS. <SEP> modules cover that quite nicely. <SEP> i should read the docs <SEP> discord already had all that baked into its official lib <SEP> My approach would be to have a directory of your commands that are just modules that fit the interface you want.

Summarization," <SEP> :thumbsup: <SEP> thanks both <SEP> One other major difference is how index types work on interfaces versus type aliases.`interface Foo { value: string }`creates a type `Foo` that may have additional properties. `{ value: string }` does not. <SEP> I don't think that's the case - if a function takes a parameter of type `{ value: string }` you can freely pass something with more <SEP> It's part of structural typing <SEP> Typescript may complain that `Foo does not have an index signature` when using an `interface`.

Summarization," <SEP> @sheshtiwari first of all I canoot see implementation of `getDefaultChannel()` in your listings I belive the obvious issue that `getDefaultChannel()` returns `undefined`.  Why it returns `undefined` depends on implementaion. What I could see is that `initChannels` is asyncronious and might not be called, or it might be called but not completed before `channelService` is injected for `RoleService`.  If it is called - I suggest to make `getDefaultChannel` async and rewrite assignment to next `role.channels =  <SEP> othewrise you have to call `initChannels` in every service that consumes `ChannelService` <SEP> is there a way to exclude files in the tsconfig.json via terminal like the compiler options? e.g  `tsc --init  -t ES5 -exclude node_modulee` ?",is there a way to exclude files in tsconfig.json?

Summarization," <SEP> Very interesting, thanks.  Any ideas how I represent what I want? I have reducers that don't take an action.  I tried making `action?` optional but then it complains everywhere that I'm not guarding against it possibly being undefined. <SEP> Oh sorry you just gave me an example. <SEP> Yeah.

Wait. That works... <SEP> Oh geez. Okay so my mindset has been wrong. I've been thinking that because my type defines two arguments, it would be an error if I tried to apply that type to a function that only takes one. <SEP> Oh interesting. So the function definition doesn't complain anymore. But usage of that function complains that I'm not passing it a second argument.  So while unfortunate.
