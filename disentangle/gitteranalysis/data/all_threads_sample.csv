54fe3960846ca2ce6e20b57a,"@otodockal hey man, the reasons are due to the limitations of those browsers.

If my assumptions are correct then building out an isomorphic solution for Angular2 would allow ""support” for legacy system such as IE9, IE10, IE8 or even IE6-7 if you're crazy. The idea behind it is the contract you create going down the isomorphic route for your web apps. 

Why does that matter and how does it solve my problem? Well let me explain a it about the past so think of it this way. For IE8 and IE9 how do we support animations? Well we don't support them at all we turn them off and the same thing goes for hashbang urls. Now think about when these browsers were created and how websites were made back in IE8 days, for now I'm going to call these browsers legacy. The best way to create apps back in the day were server rendered apps and in 2005 Rails became the best framework (and still is) of 2005. If we apply the same solution for web apps made in 2005 then that means we render them on the server and send them down to the client. But there is a subtle difference between then and now.

Over the years the goal of websites remained the same while the technology and complexity dramatically increased. This means we have a lot more control on the server and client in terms of performance and flexibility today. So let's go back to the problem at hand and gage what we can do with legacy browsers. We lose out of performance and flexibility on the client, but we still have that on the server. With the isomorphic web app whenever there is an action by the user the app renders the current state of the app to the user. This is the same for websites that were built in the past (user clicks on a link new page is sent down) during the same time as these legacy browsers. We can either send down a small amount of javascript or omit them completely (my choice) and the web app will still work. How does it work without javascript or an api? Since our pages are server rendered that means we can keep the api on the server without a need on the client. For every user action we would do the same thing websites did in the past and that is make another request to render the page yet again. We do this already navigating between domains. For example we can build our directives and routers to account for legacy forms allowing urlencoded form submission and of course links generated by the router etc.

Why do we want this? Well legacy users are mostly enterprise and they do not have a choice in the matter in fact they may even have restrictions on javascript. For them you send them the page without javascript and they're more then happy since they have a website that works. Remember the goal here is providing a way for users to support legacy with a minimal amount of work to the developer. 


Okay great we have a solution for legacy users by learning from the past and applying solutions from to problems we still have today. Keep in mind when dealing with enterprise users they usually just want the website just to work while everything else is just an enhancement to the user experience. Consumer facing customers have the choice of upgrading their browsers or continuing down the legacy route so they are more likely to upgrade. 

This is great we can develop angular2 is different environments going down the isomorphic path. Are you sure we can do this? Yes we can do this already using React and the benefits of going down the isomorphic path is only starting to become apparent. Do we benefit at all for web apps today and future? We do, in fact having an isomorphic constraint forces the framework to work in muliple environments determined by the developer. Now imagine running Angular2 running on server/web worker/web/mobile/desktop/cars you can see where this is going ",man reason due limitations browsers assumptions correct build isomorphic solution angular allow support legacy system even crazy idea behind contract create isomorphic route web apps matter solve problem well let explain past think way support animations well support turn thing bang urls think browsers create websites make back days call browsers legacy best way create apps back day server render apps rail become best framework still apply solution web apps make mean render server send client subtle difference years goal websites remain technology complexity dramatically increase mean lot control server client term performance flexibility today let back problem hand gage legacy browsers lose performance flexibility client still server isomorphic web app whenever action user app render current state app user websites build past user click link new page send time legacy browsers either send small amount javascript omit completely choice web app still work work without javascript since page server render mean keep server without need client every user action thing websites past make another request render page yet already navigate domains example build directives routers account legacy form allow rule cod form submission course link generate router etc want well legacy users mostly enterprise choice matter fact may even restrictions javascript send page without javascript happy since website work remember goal provide way users support legacy minimal amount work developer okay great solution legacy users learn past apply solutions problems still today keep mind deal enterprise users usually want website work everything else enhancement user experience consumer face customers choice upgrade browsers continue legacy route likely upgrade great develop angular different environments isomorphic path sure yes already use react benefit isomorphic path start become apparent benefit web apps today future fact isomorphic constraint force framework work multiple environments determine developer imagine run angular run serve web workerwebmobiledesktopcars see,2015-03-09 11:28:06.657000+00:00,gdi2290,angular/angular,1,0,0,0,"enhancement user, enhancement else","[7, 8, 9]"

55021f0d987b29785191d0a6,"yeah there are a few different ways to deal with data flow depending on your use caseone approach, which is easy to reason about, is having container components (they inject the Store) where they maintain the state for their children. For a simple app you can maintain one container component aka <app> that will pass data down state to it’s children through bindings 
```html
<data-container>
  <child-food [data]=“state.tacos”></child-food>
  <child-users [data]=“state.users”></child-users>
</data-container>
```
it all depends on: use case, size of the app, and amount of people working on it. In other words the abstraction level should be higher depending on how many people are on the project as well as how large the app will be. 

So no there isn’t a recommended way of doing things but that’s just because the framework still alpha. Of course what’s I’m personally recommending is only my opinion but I’m planning of giving examples for each use case when Angular2 reaches beta","different ways deal data flow depend use case

I believe at a high level the reason for the explicitness is to ensure that tooling can be built around Angular2 to do better static analysis of your code (i.e. for autocomplete and build time error checking). Some of it is also linked to performance because when Angular knows exactly what dependencies are part of a component, it can make certain assumptions (i.e. not every element and attribute is potentially something special). So, this all makes sense in a way at a lower level. The thing we want, however, is potentially some sugar to make our code more concise.@mhevery would there be any issues with at least making certain angular core items like Component, Foreach and Template global?nan","sure solution think help understand motivations issue bring believe high level reason explicitness ensure tool build around angular better static analysis code auto complete build time error check link performance angular know exactly dependencies part component make certain assumptions every element attribute potentially something special make sense way lower level thing want however potentially sugar make code concise

Here's my two cents though.  By the time 1.5 is released, everything that's in Angular2 will be valid TypeScript, including decorators/annotations, ES6 imports, destructuring assignments, etc.  Although, `tsc` does complain about not specifying types, so I see two directions here.  The Angular team will provide us with an ES5 compiled version of Angular2 and a TypeScript definition file, or they will make the current code compilable with `tsc`.  I see the former happening in the short term and the latter happening long-term.This opens the doors for a few things... you won't necessarily have to use System for modules, I see browserify or webpack as viable alternatives (bundled vs. non-bundled).  And you shouldn't have to solely depend on traceur as a run-time dependency. 
Just my two cents though, what do I know.","decorators road map typescript although look like outstanding issue reference track progress heres two cents though time release everything angular valid typescript include decorator annotations import restructure assignments etc although tsp complain specify type see two directions angular team provide compile version angular typescript definition file make current code comp liable tsp see former happen short term latter happen lon term

I’m trying to get `Compiler` running in node.js but I’m running into problems with DOM. I also noticed `Parse5DomAdapter` so I’m assuming I need to bind `DomAdapter` to `Parse5DomAdapter` or maybe I’m mistaken.

One problem I’m running into atm is in `UrlResolver` `DOM` wasn’t injected so I can’t overwrite it.

```bash

I think performance was a major consideration, but also maintainability for large apps. two-way data binding can cause more issues than it solves once your app starts to grow in size and complexity. That said, it is useful for prototyping so it would be nice to have a standard, concise syntax for it.@swirlycheetah it seems like there are fundamentally two differences in Rob's example. 

1. The Aurelia code is depending on two-way data binding for updates. This is technically possible in Angular2 (see @KenavR's last comment) but it is debatable when/how you actually want to use this. I don't think it is a given that you want EVERYTHING using two-way data binding.
2. It seems like Aurelia is using a lot of convention to automatically figure out which modules are important, which template is used, etc. Although all the Angular2 code you see right now is going to be explicit like this, I actually think there is no reason why you can't use convention based sugar like Aurelia is using and just have the build step auto-generate the explicit template annotation, etc.

Basically, I think it is way too early draw any conclusions from code differences.

But this benefit remove possibility of fine-graned control should it executed or not. Even in my specific example, if before writing to property there would be a check for equals it will solve. But in general situation it becomes hard to check equality of property's value and new value...

May be this something that could be taking into account by Angular2 team...Proof of my words is the only solution I've found for Angular2:
```
<div>	
   {{name}}
   <input [value]=""name1"" #nameone (keyup)=""updateName(nameone.value,'1')"">
   <input [value]=""name2"" #nametwo (keyup)=""updateName(nametwo.value,'2')"">

Here is a design doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1US9h0ORqBltl71TlEU6s76ix8SUnOLE2jabHVg9xxEA/edit#heading=h.oisbys59gdxa and here is the current code in progress https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/master/modules/angular2/src/forms There will be a solution which will be similar to `ng-model` but not identical.
