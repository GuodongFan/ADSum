571,571,Well I'm trying to understand what modules you are actually mapping to somewhere else,well try understand modules actually map somewhere else
572,572,to see if you are doing it correctly or not,see correctly
573,573,declare module 'xxx'needs to be in ad.tsfile,declare module xxxneeds
574,574,"It's actually just not finding the modules from the same folder.

575,575,oh ok.. so it' snot from yourd.tsfiles that's the problem,snot thats problem
576,576,"Actually I changed it to ""./clientdata"" and that seemed to work",actually change clientdata seem work
577,577,yeah so when you don't do relative paths..,dont relative paths
578,578,it will try to resolve modules fromnode_modules,try resolve modules fromnodemodules
579,579,ohh,ohh
580,580,even though I added my src folder to rootDirs?,even though add src folder rootdirs
581,581,it will walk up your folders,walk folders
582,582,so first don't add your src folder torootDirs,first dont add src folder torootdirs
583,583,you want to set it forrootDir,want set forrootdir
584,584,now... if youw ant it to work like you had,youw ant work like
585,585,you need to add some path mappings,need add path mappings
586,586,I see... I am ok with using './' I think it is probably a better practice,see use think probably better practice
587,587,"I do have one more question, it is not happening on my computer but it is happening on my friend's. He tried to open it up and has 1000s of ""duplicate identifier"" errors from d.ts files.",one question happen computer happen friends try open duplicate identifier errors file
588,588,webpack build also does work on his machine,webpack build work machine
589,589,you can use baseUrl too for it to work without relative paths,use baseurl work without relative paths
590,590,for best intellisense and IDE support it's always good to make sure your project compiles fine through planetsc,best intellisense ide support always good make sure project compile fine planetsc
591,591,just make sure you do --noEmit or something,make sure noemit something
592,592,unless you want a gazillion .js files generated throughout your codebase,unless want gazillion file generate throughout codebase
593,593,or use outDir,use outdir
594,594,I would have to know the duplicate identifiers,know duplicate identifiers
595,595,it's likely stuff in hisnode_module/@types/*folder conflicting with maybe old-school typings files from typings or tsd,likely stuff conflict maybe oldschool type file type tsd
596,596,"That sounds likely, so I should get rid of one or the other?",sound likely get rid one
597,597,"Also, should the d.ts files be included in the project?",file include project
598,598,you should get rid of the typings/tsd installed ones if they have that,get rid typingstsd instal ones

601,601,all definitely typed typings files are available as npm packages,definitely type type file available npm package
602,602,and that's the prefered way going forward for third-party global typings,thats prefer way forward thirdparty global type
603,603,you should include d.ts files in the project yes,include file project yes
604,604,you don't need to include any that are installed with npm in@typesthough,dont need include instal npm
605,605,Got it,get
606,606,ususally people will have 1 or 2 custom ones,ususally people custom ones
607,607,that are included globally,include globally
608,608,for custom typings you may want to add,custom type may want add
609,609,or if a particular project has a stand-alone typings file they publish outside of definitely typed (more rare),particular project standalone type file publish outside definitely type rare
610,610,most projects will either include d.ts file in the standard npm package (e.g. like angular2 for example) or they will have third-party typings you can install using@types/package-name,project either include file standard npm package like angular example thirdparty type install
611,611,"it's rare to have a project just have their own random d.ts file you donwload and install, although there are a few cases out there",rare project random file donwload install although case
612,612,sometimes for client-side external libraries,sometimes clientside external libraries
613,613,"///<reference path=""../../typings/tsd.d.ts"" />is a line into node_modules needed for@types?",line nodemodules need
614,614,no you should get rid of that,get rid
