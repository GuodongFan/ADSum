# General Guidelines

This is both a guide for how to annotate, and instructions on what to annotate.
At a high level, the goal of this annotation is to create a link/edge from each
message to the 0+ messages that it is a response to.

## How to annotate

The line being linked will have green text. The line it is being linked to will
be underlined. At the moment, the top line should be both green and underlineed.

  >> Try moving the green line down by pressing SHIFT + DOWN (OS X only) or SHIFT + 'o'.
  >> Now try moving it up with SHIFT + UP (OS X only) or SHIFT + 'i'.

Move the green line down a few lines and try moving the underlined line with
UP and DOWN (or 'o' and 'i'). Note that the underlined line cannot go below the
green line.

  >> Try creating a link by typing SHIFT + d (i.e. D).

Note that once linked, the text turns blue (if it is not green).

  >> Try removing the link by typing SHIFT + d again.
  >> Now re-create the link with 'd'.

Note that when typing lowercase 'd', the link is created and then the green
line is moved down one and the underlined line is changed to be right above it.

  >> Move the green line back up one
  >> Link a second line to this one using SHIFT + d
  >> Now press 'u' to undo all links for this line

To search for text, type a '\' and the text you want to search for. Press ENTER
and then n or p to go to the next or previous occurrence (or SHIFT + n and
SHIFT + p to move the green line). To change the search query, type '\' again
and edit. Note - '?' and '!' cannot be searched for, they are used as
alternatives to ENTER and BACKSPACE.

Do not do it yet, but you can move between files in your list with ']' and '['. Any
annotations will be saved when you change files, and recovered when you return.
To quit, type 'q'.

If you ever want to see the help info without opening this, type 'h'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General case

For each message, link it to 1 or more messages it is a response to.

If it does not respond to anything, link it to itself.

If it appears to respond to something, but you can't find it, leave no link.



## Scenarios:

Find a tricky case not covered here? Note it and send it to me.

Social messages
    <kkathman> night ladies and gents :)
    <Liberal_Tugboat> well night all!
    <samatman_> night

    [03:53] <chmod775> is there any VPN software for ubuntu ?
    [03:53] <jind> love your nick
    
--- In the first case, <samatman_>'s comment would be linked to the previous
--- two, but <jind>'s comment would not be linked to <chmod775>'s. The
--- reasoning is that side comments like these are not part of the technical
--- conversation, but rather form their own, separate conversation.


Question is repeated
--- Link the repeat to the original ask (e.g. if asked three times, the second
--- and third would both link to the first).


Message Responds to Multiple Previous Messages
    <Bashing-om> Maube a fault in your mirror ? Maybe wait a spell and see if the
                 mirror syncs up with mother .. or change your mirror ?
    <lordcirth> Yes, the next thing to try would be switching mirrors
    <ShinyShoes> this could be the mirror problem, you're right

--- Link <ShinyShoes> message to both of the previous messages.


User Responds to Messsage Multiple Times.
    <OerHeks> you might want to reask in #ubuntu-server
    <fels> Thanks -
    <fels> are they brutal to newbies :)

    <zxc_> I'm thinking of just locating it and then using MPV to open it
    <nacc> not sure i follow -- of course you have to know where the file is
    <nacc> oh you mean you want to do `locate ... | mpv` ?

    <tgm4883> If you know you aren't supposed to come here, then why did you?
    <ThePotato> because the other chat is broked
    <ThePotato> for the distro

--- There are two extremes here:
--- (1) Each message could stand alone as a response (e.g. <fels>)
--- (2) The messages form one thought (e.g. <ThePotato>)
---
--- In (1), link both messages from <fels> directly to the message from
--- <OerHeks>. In (2), link the second message from <ThePotato> to the first
--- message from <ThePotato>. The case with <nacc> is closer to (1), but is
--- less clear.


User is Engaged in Multiple Conversations
    <henry> can anyone tell me how to install a new package on ubuntu 14.04?
    <thomas> Is it necessary to create a liveUSB drive to install ubuntu?
    <henry> you can also burn an .iso file to a cd to install

    <Onepamopa> does anyone know HOW to auto execute a command AFTER user login
                (Unity) ?
    <Onepamopa> or how to permanently disable mouse acceleration
    <dankan> let me tell you
    <dankan> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_acceleration see the bit
             "disabling mouse acceleration"ty

--- No need to ensure all of a user's messages are in a single graph. Only link
--- <henry>'s second message to <thomas>'s message. In the example of
--- <Onepamopa> it is less clear, but they should probably be linked as they
--- form one overall problem.
---
--- For <dankan>'s messages, you need to either:
--- (1) Link both of them to the last message from <Onepamopa>
--- (2) Link both of them to both of <Onepamopa>'s messages.
--- 
--- You should do (1) when <Onepamopa>'s messages formed a single question. Do
--- (2) when they formed separate questions, but somehow were both answered at
--- the same time.


Interjections / Noise
    <ctf2> ddd
    <ctf2> adasdaasddas

--- Treat each as a separate interjection - do not link to anything.


Use of ubottu, an IRC bot:
    <karen_> hi, guys, I just got lubuntu 16.04, don't know it well, but I
             don't see anywhere to download "Skype". I looked in synaptic
             package and Lubuntu Software. What should I do?
    <OerHeks> !skype
    <ubottu> To install Skype on Ubuntu, see
             https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype,
             check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use
             open protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga
    <karen_> I see, I'll try that.

--- Link ubottu's response to both the person who called it (<OerHeks>) and the
--- person the information is directed at (<karen_>). If someone then says
--- something that is essentially a response to the bot, link the message to the
--- bot's message.


Handling a series of lines of output:
    <discord> i get the msg
    <discord> mplayer-k6:
    <discord> Depends: libartsc0 but it is not going to be installed
    <discord> Depends: libfribidi0 but 0.10.4-3 is to be installed
    <discord> Depends: libggi2 but it is not going to be installed
    <discord> Depends: libpng12-0 but 1.2.5.0-7ubuntu1 is to be installed
    <discord> Depends: libungif4g but 4.1.0b1-6 is to be installed
    <discord> What's wrong?
    <henry> You need to install some libraries
    <henry> Get libggi2 from http://...

--- Here, link:
---    "mplayer-k6:"      to "i get the msg"
---    "Depends: ..."     to both the line one previous, and "i get the msg"
---    "What's wrong?"    to "mplayer-k6"
---    <henry>'s 1st msg  to "What's wrong?"
---    <henry>'s 2nd msg  to the "Depends: libggi" message
---
--- The intuition is that messages in the sequence are all linked together in a
--- chain, and also linked to the message the chunk is a response to. Follow-up
--- messages (including from the same user) are linked to the message that is
--- most semantically relevant, or the top of the chunk if they are generally a
--- response to the whole chunk.
