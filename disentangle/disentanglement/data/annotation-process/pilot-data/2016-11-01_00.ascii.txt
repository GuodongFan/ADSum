[00:07] <dylan> do you mean?
[00:07] <backbox> printers are auto scan if you are in LAN
[00:08] <dylan> sorry, but English please.
[00:08] <OerHeks> dylan, check openprinting.org for your model, if no driver is available check vendor website
[00:08] <apb1963_> backbox, Type "/msg NickServ help register" no quotes.
[00:08] <maddawg2> lol add a printer... wtf is this Windows?
[00:08] <ikonia> maddawg2: its not an unreaonable question, tone down the language please
[00:08] <backbox> yes I did
[00:08] <apb1963_> dylan, Go to http://127.0.0.1:631
[00:08] <dylan> maddawg2, you are the reason people don't use linux.
[00:09] <dylan> it's because the community isn't always patient
[00:09] <ikonia> dylan: the problem you have is that brother have limited linux support, so it will depend on the model how you can use it
[00:09] <dylan> okay, thanks for the help
[00:09] <dylan> I'll do some more research on the printer.
[00:09] <maddawg2> sheesh i was joking
[00:09] <dylan> bye

[00:14] <backbox> helllojesus12, search on google

[00:14] <backbox> helllojesus12, first form will give the answer.
[00:14] <ikonia> backbox: you've just asked for basic help, someone has a specific question and then you tell them to google - unacceptble
[00:14] <ikonia> helllojesus12: ok, so you want the users to access tomcat via a browser ?
[00:14] <apb1963_> helllojesus12,  Then there's really not much to do other than installing ubuntu and then tomcat...

[00:16] <helllojesus12> the reason I ask is I want to set it up right the first time.. and I am not sure what is the right way..
[00:16] <backbox> ikonia, setup local server using ubuntu
[00:18] <ikonia> backbox: read more
[00:20] <apb1963_> helllojesus12, Just set it up the normal way.  Do you know how to do that?
[00:20] <apb1963_> helllojesus12, Do you have ubuntu installed on the server yet?

[00:21] <backbox> apb1963_, using this  /msg NickServ REGISTER "bar" "foo@bar.com" allow me to access all the channel right ..
[00:21] <apb1963_> backbox, Other than invite only channels, yes.
[00:21] <backbox> apb1963_, , if i type here    /msg NickServ REGISTER "123456" "132456foo@bar.com" this every one can se it
[00:21] <helllojesus12> There are a lot guides but some are outdated and I rather do it the best way possible...
[00:21] <helllojesus12> I am going to follow this guide and see how it goes..

[00:23] <backbox> ahahah
[00:25] <helllojesus12> I didnt know there were different versions of ubuntu
[00:25] <ikonia> helllojesus12: I think you may want to step back a little
[00:25] <OerHeks> !flavor
[00:25] <ubottu> Recognized Ubuntu flavors build on Ubuntu and provide a different user experience out of the box. They are supported both in #ubuntu and in their flavor channel. The current list is: !Edubuntu, !Ubuntu-GNOME, !Kubuntu, Ubuntu !Kylin, !Lubuntu, !Mythbuntu, Ubuntu !Studio, !Xubuntu, and Ubuntu !MATE
[00:25] <ikonia> helllojesus12: get a better grasp of the basics of what ubuntu is, and what it means to use it
[00:26] <ikonia> helllojesus12: then maybe plan on how to serve some people some pages via tomcat with the basics clear in your head
[00:28] <helllojesus12> Yeah, I have a lot to read. My goal right now is to set up a small environment where me and my friends can code and put stuff.
[00:28] <ikonia> helllojesus12: I'd get a better grasp of the very high level basics before moving forward
[00:28] <helllojesus12> Do you have any specific reading you would suggest ikonia ?

[01:40] <MegaBrutal> Hi all! I want to try the Livepatch Service, but I don't want to risk installing it on a productive machine right away, so I thought to test it in KVM. But I'm afraid it would count against my quota of 3 machines. Can I deauthorize the VM after I tested the service on it?

[01:45] <mikeymop> Hey
[01:46] <mikeymop> Anyone experienced with network manager
[01:47] <kk4ewt> mikeymop,  whats your question
[01:48] <Flannel> MegaBrutal: That's a question for Canonical, not Ubuntu.  I'm not entirely sure which channel will be able to answer it, but if you ask in #canonical-sysadmin, they'll be able to point you to the correct Canonical channel (or answer you directly)
[01:49] <mikeymop> I noticed in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections there are config files
[01:49] <mikeymop> I found e3 for my ethernet nic
[01:49] <mikeymop> Inside I found a name for my ethernet connection with user specified
[01:49] <mikeymop> I want to add root as a user, is this dangerous?
[01:50] <mikeymop> kk4ewt: ^
[01:50] <kk4ewt> i wouldnt
[01:50] <ircclcv2> What is the meaning of jargonic ?
[01:51] <kk4ewt> was it wireless or wired connection
[01:51] <mikeymop> Wired
[01:51] <kk4ewt> still wouldnt
[01:51] <mikeymop> The reason: my kubuntu box I canot ssh into unless I first login
[01:51] <mikeymop> Because network manager won't initialize unless I login
[01:52] <mikeymop> I saw a post saying to check "make connection available to all users" I was curious if this was comparable
[01:52] <kk4ewt> no the nm-applet isnt
[01:52] <kk4ewt> mikeymop,  is this a desktop or lappy
[01:53] <mikeymop> Old desktop relegated as a web, mail and Plex server
[01:53] <kk4ewt> turn off NM and start networking
[01:53] <mikeymop> 'networking'?
[01:54] <kk4ewt> systemctl disable NetworkManager
[01:54] <kk4ewt> systemctl enable networking
[01:54] <kk4ewt> that should start your wired connection on every boot
[01:54] <kk4ewt> it may be network
[01:55] <mikeymop> I checked it's status /sbin/ifup
[01:55] <mikeymop> Gave me an exit code. Probably because nm is running.
[01:55] <mikeymop> I'm assuming this will terminate my connection so I should wait until I can be by my device?
[01:56] <lordcirth> mikeymop, quite possibly, yeah I wouldn't do it over ssh
[01:56] <ubu1> SOA
[01:56] <mikeymop> It's networking definitely
[01:57] <mikeymop> kk4ewt: does this require separate configuration? I have some vms NAT'd and several port rules
[01:58] <kk4ewt> nope
[01:58] <kk4ewt> NetworkManager is basicly for lappies
[01:58] <kk4ewt> something that needs to be able to switch back and worth
[01:59] <mikeymop> I was going to say odd, but this is Ubuntu
[01:59] <ubu1> call +1-801-456-1000
[01:59] <kk4ewt> between wired and wireless
[01:59] <ubu1> it is your provider
[01:59] <mikeymop> I do have a wifi card, but it's not often used
[01:59] <kk4ewt> mikeymop,  no its not odd its in other distros as well
[02:00] <kk4ewt> by letting the user select which network allows that flexibility
[02:00] <mikeymop> Ok so not just a back end. It's also the applet used on DEs?
[02:01] <mikeymop> Used to the /network/interfaces
[02:01] <kk4ewt> yes
[02:01] <ubu1> kick in window your mac
[02:01] <ubu1> 2mac
[02:01] <mikeymop> Gotcha, you cleared up a lot, better than the wikis

[02:50] <flink> Hi everyone! I want to know if it's worth it to defragment a hard disk with Ext4 FileSystem on Ubuntu or if it is absolutely useless?
[02:50] <lordcirth> flink, did you fill it past 90%?
[02:50] <lordcirth> If not, you probably don't need to
[02:51] <flink> I have a 3Tb (1,5 Tb used) for my video streaming and a 500gb for my os (about 20% used)
[02:51] <lordcirth> Then it won't be fragmented
[02:51] <lordcirth> either of them
[02:51] <kk4ewt> flink,  the OS will check it after so many boots
[02:52] <lordcirth> kk4ewt, does the auto fsck do defrag too?
[02:52] <flink> lorccirth thank you!
[02:52] <lordcirth> np
[02:52] <kk4ewt> it will do what it needs not really a defrag as in the windows world
[02:54] <flink> kk4ewt That's what I thought!
[02:54] <dax> fsck does not do defragmentation. lordcirth's comments on fullness are correct
[02:54] <dax> there is a defragmentation tool for ext4, but it's pointless if you're not filling your filesystem enough
