[03:11] <brenner> IdleOne: awwww :)
[03:11] <dylan_> how do i downgrade my apps if they're not stable?
[03:11] <Kamping_Kaiser> later IdleOne :)

[03:11] <heyjoe2> is there a way i can safely unmount my usb device
[03:12] <heyjoe2> using the command line, it doesnt work when i use the click method
[03:12] <Kamping_Kaiser> lightstep: to change the hostname you edi t "/etc/hostname" and "/etc/hosts"
[03:12] <Kamping_Kaiser> and this is one time i do condone use of a root terminal.
[03:12] <jlinden_> How do I print raw text data to ipp printer?? anyone?
[03:12] <lightstep> heyjoe2, try sudo umount /path/to/device
[03:13] <n3m3s1s> http://www.rafb.net/paste/results/CJPcEf87.html < can you help me plz
[03:13] <heyjoe2> thanks
[03:13] <thenuke> n3m3s1s: maybe it will work some other time
[03:14] <heyjoe2> lightstep: so if its on the desktop i go sudo unmount /desktop/new volume
[03:14] <jetscreamer> try a different source
[03:14] <n3m3s1s> HmmM
[03:14] <n3m3s1s> Can you give me a "clean source" ?

[03:16] <heyjoe2> brenner: http://pastebin.com/594432
[03:18] <brenner> heyjoe2: can you do a : cd /media/NEW VOLUME
[03:18] <marlun> Does Debian also force you to use sudo by default?
[03:18] <brenner> heyjoe2: and see if that is the usb drive when you do an ls
[03:18] <netface> no codecs open divx and mp3, why?
[03:18] <brenner> marlun: not afaik.  tehy still stick with the root account
[03:18] <heyjoe2> brenner: it says no such file or directory when i do the cd command
[03:19] <brenner> heyjoe2: what command did you use?
[03:19] <marlun> ok, thanks
[03:19] <heyjoe2> cd /media/NEW VOLUME
[03:19] <Diogo> Any GRUB gurus around?!
[03:19] <brenner> netface: ubuntu can't provide them out of the box legally.  see here to install them: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
[03:19] <rambo3>  /j #grub
[03:20] <brenner> heyjoe2: it's probablhy the space.  type cd /media/NEW and then press tab
[03:20] <jetscreamer> Diogo: #grub
[03:20] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Thanks! :o)
[03:20] <p3> hi plz - how co change encoding? it isnt nice when there is (invalid encoding) and i cant choose wallpaper from that folder :D and some webpages are too sick...

[03:20] <n3m3s1s> What's wrong?
[03:20] <jetscreamer> rambo3: :p
[03:20] <rambo3> cd /media/NEW \VOLUME
[03:20] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Hmmm... Even if my GRUB question is ubuntu-specific?!
[03:20] <jetscreamer> n3m3s1s: it's just a key you didn't impoirt yet. you can ignore it till you find out how
[03:21] <n3m3s1s> or can i del it?
[03:21] <jetscreamer> Diogo: can't hurt to just ask in both channels
[03:21] <heyjoe2> brenner: that seems to have done good
[03:21] <jetscreamer> n3m3s1s: you can just comment out the new source
[03:21] <jetscreamer> n3m3s1s: but like i said it's an ignorable error

[03:21] <jetscreamer> !keys
[03:21] <ubotu> jetscreamer: Wish I knew. Try searching at http://ubuntu.cc.com.au/, jetscreamer
[03:21] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Here we go, then: I'd like to 'lock' my 'recovery mode' entries, but they are inside the AUTOMAGIC section and I wouldn't like to hurt automagic, so how do I proceed?
[03:21] <jetscreamer> dumbot
[03:22] <heyjoe2> brenner: i think its opened newvolume
[03:22] <n3m3s1s> ok
[03:22] <brenner> heyjoe2: ls shows the contents of the stick?
[03:22] <jetscreamer> Diogo: you could just copy the ones and put them below the magic line
[03:22] <jlinden_> I cant enable 3d hardware acceleration when Im using xinerama for dual head, i have intel embedded graphics chip... anyone know any solution?
[03:22] <heyjoe2> brenner: yep the contents are correct
[03:22] <Healot> how do I patch an original tarball (tar.gz) with it
[03:23] <brenner> heyjoe2: then that's the one you want. to unmount: sudo umount /dev/sda5
[03:23] <heyjoe2> exactly as it is?
[03:23] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Do you mean copying the line blocks of those sections and re-insert them below with the lock line included?
[03:23] <bigfoot1> p3: i have an avi file. how can i record just the audio of that as an mp3?
[03:23] <brenner> heyjoe2: yep.  weird that you can't unmount via desktop though
[03:23] <Healot> its gzipped diff file?
[03:24] <rambo3> why dont you just unpack and aplay patch , repack
[03:24] <jetscreamer> Diogo: lock line? i mean copy , title to boot,  each section you want to preserve against automagic, and paste below ethe 'end debian automagic' or whatever it says in ubuntu
[03:25] <heyjoe2> brenner: it says device is busy, but im not using it for anything
[03:25] <heyjoe2> brenner: that i can see
[03:25] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: lsof heyjoe2
[03:26] <Nabiki> :P I got a message saying
[03:26] <heyjoe2> whats lsof
[03:26] <Nabiki> :P I got a message saying SSL version 2 is disabled.
[03:26] <jetscreamer> type it
[03:26] <joefso3> HOW DO i GET XGL WORKING ON DEBIAN?
[03:26] <jetscreamer> LiStOpenFiles
[03:26] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Ok, and then I add the 'lock' line right below the 'initrd' line, right? Will these new blocks overwrite the automagic ones?
[03:26] <jetscreamer> joe_alf: /topic #debian
[03:27] <jetscreamer> Diogo: what lock line
[03:27] <heyjoe2> brenner: what do i do if it says its busy in terminal
[03:27] <jetscreamer> you don't need a lock line, just anything under where it says end debian magic won't be touched
[03:27] <brenner> joefso3: ask #debian
[03:27] <Diogo> jetscreamer, To have an entry locked in grub, I need the 'lock' line right below the 'initrd' line, afaik...
[03:27] <Diogo> jetscreamer, I want them password-locked.
[03:27] <joefso3> brenner:  why?
[03:27] <jetscreamer> Diogo: ahhh
[03:28] <Diogo> jetscreamer, :o)
[03:28] <jetscreamer> dobrev: apt-get install grub-doc, info grub
[03:28] <brenner> joefso3: b/c this is an ubuntu channel
[03:28] <henk> Hi can anyone help me set up my ati card (readon 9100) i tried to install the ati propiatary driver but it did not work for me. So i removed all the related stuff. reinstalled ristricted driver, kernel 2.6.12.15-18 and reset my xorg.conf to user 'fglrx' as a driver. However i now keep faling back to mesa and i cannot figure out why it is no longer working. Anyone that has experience with this?
[03:28] <Diogo> jetscreamer, And I'd like it to be set as automagically-compliant as possible. ;o)
[03:28] <joefso3> brenner: I'm using ubuntu ?
[03:28] <brenner> joefso3: i don't know. are you?
[03:28] <brenner> >_>
[03:28] <joefso3> brenner: why would I be here? haha
[03:28] <jetscreamer> Diogo: i never did passwd in grub. i thought you didn't want the automagic to touch it, like having a failsafe.
[03:28] <elkbuntu> !xgl
[03:28] <ubotu> XGL on Ubuntu: http://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto - Join #ubuntu-xgl for all the XGL fun on Ubuntu systems. It works ONLY on dapper. Pretty videos on http://www.novell.com/linux/xglrelease/
[03:29] <rambo3> on ati you have to omit some Option "" and use Device Driver "ati"
[03:29] <devios> the kubuntu live cd couldn't auomatically set up sound on my Dell Optiplex GX240 - on-board sound.  anyone know how to fix?
[03:29] <brenner> joefso3: you asked a question relating directly to debian.  therefore, it's better to ask the folk at @debian
[03:29] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Oh, no. Well, you just need the "password" line set and then add lines with 'lock' right below 'initrd'. I just didn't want to hurt the automagic system.
[03:29] <brenner> heyjoe2: ask jetscreamer.  he seems to have an idea.  i usually just reboot.
[03:30] <heyjoe2> brenner: http://pastebin.com/594461 thats the error message i get
[03:30] <jetscreamer> Diogo: it will be overwritten unless you add it to the auto stuff above, or cp one below the line
[03:30] <henk> rambo3:  and elkbuntu if that was for me... i'm not trying to set up glx (it definately does not work with my ati card,) im trying to revert back to the old situation
[03:30] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: any idea on how to help me. this is the error message i get when i try to click unmount http://pastebin.com/594461
[03:30] <elkbuntu> henk, no it was for heyjoe2
[03:30] <henk> elkbuntu:  ok sorry
[03:30] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: i just thought you could run lsof and see what's trying to acces it
[03:30] <Diogo> jetscreamer, Yeah, I was wondering if the auto stuff would solve this problem...
[03:31] <rambo3> henk:  is X working+
[03:31] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: sorry im a newbie, how do i run lsof
[03:31] <jetscreamer> jsut type it
[03:31] <heyjoe2> elkbuntu: what was for me
[03:31] <jetscreamer> maybe add sudo
[03:31] <henk> rambo3:  yes x works. the open gl driver just falls back to mesa instead of fglrx
[03:31] <elkbuntu> heyjoe2, the information ubotu said about xgl
[03:31] <Healot> oh, now i get how the hell to patch source package...
[03:32] <elkbuntu> ubotu, tell heyjoe2 about xgl
[03:32] <jetscreamer> /media/NEW\040VOLUME <--
[03:32] <brenner> elkbuntu: you must be tired. :) he's having unmounting issues.  nothing to do with xgl
[03:32] <jetscreamer> / not \
[03:32] <natalie> hello, I was wondering if there is anyone who might be able to help me with a problem.
[03:32] <elkbuntu> oh, wrong joe
[03:32] <jetscreamer> the other guy wanted the xgl
[03:32] <brenner> ya
[03:33] <elkbuntu> ubotu, tell joefso3 about xgl
[03:33] <brenner> natalie: ask away
[03:33] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: http://pastebin.com/594466
[03:33] <elkbuntu> the 'joe' and number parts confused me, and yes, i'm tired
[03:33] <henk> rambo3:  it seems by the way i cannot insmod 'drm' should i be able to ?
[03:33] <natalie> I recently loaded a copy of 5.10 on my PC and it freezes whenever I get to the login screen.  I can't even hit CTRL+ALT+F1 to get a terminal
[03:34] <brenner> natalie: live cd or install?
[03:34] <natalie> Install
[03:34] <rambo3> i dont think that you need drm for your kernel
[03:35] <Diogo> natalie, What if you boot in 'recovery mode'?
[03:35] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: frank... uh heyjoe2 ... cd / and umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME
[03:35] <natalie> I can boot i to recovery mode, but I'm fairly new to linux, so I'm not really sure what to do.
[03:35] <Nabiki> brb.   Gotta test something.
[03:35] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i did that
[03:35] <heyjoe2> now what
[03:36] <Diogo> natalie, Then it could be something related to X. Do you guys think natalie should 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure x-server'?
[03:36] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: type the command here exactly as you typed it
[03:36] <heyjoe2> cd / and umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME
[03:36] <brenner> Diogo: she should have got a bluescreen.  but it's worth a shot
[03:37] <heyjoe2> wrong?
[03:37] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: you typed and?
[03:37] <heyjoe2> yeah i thought that was strange
[03:37] <heyjoe2> two separate commands huh
[03:37] <jetscreamer> cd / && umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME
[03:37] <jetscreamer> try that
[03:37] <jetscreamer> one line there
[03:37] <brenner> heyjoe2: the first one isn't actually needed.
[03:38] <jetscreamer> actually since he's in the directory, yeah
[03:38] <Diogo> natalie, brenner, Sorry it's 'xserver-xorg' the name of the package.
[03:38] <Gau> Is there a way to repair a HD using an Ubuntu LiveCD?
[03:38] <Diogo> Gau, What kind of 'repair' do you mean?
[03:39] <Gau> Well, apparently the HD has an invalid node structure and the catalog b-tree is damaged
[03:39] <natalie> Diogo: Will there be anything in particular that I will need to do after that, or will it fix itself?  (Sorry I'm really new)
[03:39] <heyjoe2> ok http://pastebin.com/594481
[03:39] <milamber> someone kwnows, i try to mount my hdc7 partition, mounting works fine, buth the browser says u do not have anough permissiopns ?. looked it in fstab everything seems fine
[03:39] <vjHabib> does anyone know how to put dri in ati fglrx?
[03:40] <brenner> vjHabib: how'd you install the driver?
[03:40] <z6bt> how would i burn an audio cd with cdrecord (i dont have and cant have x)
[03:40] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: http://pastebin.com/594481
[03:40] <Diogo> natalie, I really don't know, but I'm hoping it will fix itself.
[03:40] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: add sudo.
[03:40] <natalie> Diogo, Brenner, Thanks for the help I will give it a try.
[03:41] <jetscreamer> next time, sudo lsof | grep -i /mnt/new btw
[03:41] <brenner> natalie: if that doesn't work.  search the forum using "freeze" and "login " as keywords.  it might not be a display issue
[03:41] <natalie> Okay, I'll do that
[03:41] <z6bt> does anyone know?
[03:41] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: no error msg
[03:41] <vjHabib> brenner: I follow this instruction of proprietary driver
[03:42] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: type mount
[03:42] <brenner> vjHabib: which instructions?
[03:42] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i think it worked
[03:42] <z6bt> so i take it no one knows?
[03:42] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: but i typed mount anyway
[03:42] <vjHabib> brenner: i create a .deb folowing this link http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide#Method_2:_Generating.2FInstalling_Ubuntu_packages_for_the_newer_8.23.7_drivers_in_Breezy_Badger
[03:42] <jetscreamer> z6bt: is it mounted heyjoe2 ?
[03:43] <z6bt> what?
[03:43] <vjHabib> brenner: this is in #ati
[03:43] <jetscreamer> oops
[03:43] <z6bt> what would i be mounting
[03:43] <jetscreamer> z6bt: hang on
[03:43] <z6bt> k
[03:43] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: is it mounted heyjoe2 ?
[03:43] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i typed mount and it didnt mount
[03:43] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: you mean it isn't mounted
[03:43] <Drac[Server]> I'm shutting the server down temporarily. I'll be back.
[03:44] <jetscreamer> ?
[03:44] <brenner> vjHabib: ok.  i think they're identical to the ones you should be using: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[03:44] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: typing mount should just tell you what is mounted
[03:44] <brenner> vjHabib: did you do the whole thing?
[03:44] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: http://pastebin.com/594486
[03:44] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i think it worked
[03:45] <Diogo> Anybody ever tried to 'dist-upgrade' a Debian system to Ubuntu?
[03:45] <jetscreamer> z6bt: http://www.linuxdocs.org/sln/cdcommands/
[03:45] <vjHabib> brenner: is but i'm with another kernel
[03:45] <brenner> z6bt: try #linuxhelp since it's a generic question
[03:45] <Jhair> Diogo: that would not work
[03:45] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: wtg \o/
[03:45] <Nabiki> Ok, I am up and going under linux.  :P  I keep getting weird messages from dpkg though. :)
[03:45] <brenner> vjHabib: i don't get you
[03:45] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i think it works, cos i tried it again
[03:46] <Diogo> Jhair, Hmmm... How sad I am... :'(
[03:46] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: you can't be in the directory and try to umount it at the same time :)
[03:46] <Nabiki> E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[03:46] <vjHabib> brenner: I have a kernel 2.6.13 compiled by my self
[03:46] <techmydeck> rob: im havin a problem with ubuntu. when i try to use the system configurations at gnome, they say that my root pass is wrong. anyone could help me?
[03:46] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: whenever i type umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME
[03:46] <heyjoe2> it disappears from the desktop
[03:46] <jetscreamer> right
[03:46] <elkbuntu> Diogo, although based on debian, ubuntu isnt quite the same. what would be the point if it was ;)
[03:46] <brenner> jetscreamer: whoops. that was my fault i guess
[03:47] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: good, no
[03:47] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: it's not in the fstab
[03:47] <matt__> !w32codecs
[03:47] <ubotu> bina: it has been said that w32codecs is a compilation of binary win32 A/V codecs for many popular proprietary formats not currently supported by free implementations under linux. See http://tinyurl.com/e4a5s to install
[03:47] <Jhair> techmydeck: probably you are being asked for YOUR password (sudo) and not the root password
[03:47] <Diogo> elkbuntu, I know, I know. I'd just like to migrate a system to Ubuntu. Is there another way of doing this?
[03:47] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: ok, so what do i do?
[03:47] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: and there is a setting to show unmounted volumes on the desktop somewhere also... i don't know much about automount though i don't use it
[03:48] <techmydeck> oh ok !!!!!!!!! thx
[03:48] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: probably put your command in fstab... i'd rething that new volume naming scheme if it was me though
[03:48] <brenner> vjHabib: shouldn't matter i don't think
[03:48] <jetscreamer> s/rething/rethink/
[03:48] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: simply typing umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME wont cut it to unmount
[03:48] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: some other name, maybe w/o spaces
[03:48] <heyjoe2> ok
[03:48] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: what?
[03:48] <heyjoe2> just by renaming the file
[03:48] <jetscreamer> simply typing umount /media/NEW\ VOLUME wont cut it to unmount ?
[03:49] <elkbuntu> Diogo, my guess would be: backup important info (eg, home, www ...) install ubuntu, put important info into relevent places
[03:49] <heyjoe2> sorry
[03:49] <jetscreamer> no you need a good line for it in fstab.. you don't put the actual mount command
[03:49] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: i dont know what a good line or fstab is
[03:49] <jetscreamer> make it similar to the others
[03:49] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: less /etc/fstab to see an example
[03:49] <Diogo> elkbuntu, Yeah, do it the traditional way. :o) No problem! Just wanted to know if there was an almost-automagic way to do it.
[03:50] <jetscreamer> !fstab
[03:50] <ubotu> the /etc/fstab  file lists all drives and partitions but can be easily configured automatically with the diskmounter file found here http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/diskmounter  See <partitions>.
[03:50] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: ^^
[03:50] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: how do i rename new volume
[03:50] <elkbuntu> Diogo, google around, you never know what people have managed to do, but it seems nobody in here knows of that way yet
[03:50] <matt__> is it still possible to get the w32 codecs off the servers??
[03:50] <heyjoe2> i tried to rightclick and properties but that didnt work
[03:50] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: same with rightclick rename
[03:51] <jetscreamer> mv NEW\ VOLUME someothername
[03:51] <Diogo> elkbuntu, Ok, thanks!
[03:51] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: did you create the dir with sudo? then you'll need to use sudo to mv it
[03:51] <matt__> is it still possible to get the w32 codecs off the servers??
[03:52] <heyjoe2> it says now cannot stat new volume
[03:52] <heyjoe2> jetscreamer: no such file or directory
[03:52] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: either be in the /media directory, or supply full path ... /media/NEW\ VOLUME
[03:53] <chmod775> is there any VPN software for ubuntu ?
[03:53] <Jhair> chmod775: yes
[03:53] <jind> love your nick
[03:53] <jind> chmod775: 
[03:53] <chmod775> How do I download it
[03:53] <jetscreamer> heyjoe2: so sudo mv /media/NEW\ VOLUME /media/whatever
[03:54] <Diogo> chmod775, I think 'aptitude search vpn' will give you a few choices.
[03:54] <heyjoe2> it says bash so command not found
[03:54] <heyjoe2> i type
[03:54] <drjohn> uri: does security really depend on the OS or the user or admin setting it up? im a bit confused with tihs
