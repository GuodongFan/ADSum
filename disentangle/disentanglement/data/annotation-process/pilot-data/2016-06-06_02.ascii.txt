[02:16] <superguest> I am currently running on an old ubuntu livecd session and have  downloaded and *mounted*  the 16.04.iso
[02:18] <superguest> is there a way to load the livecd installer within the currentlu running livecd session?
[02:18] <teward> superguest: no.
[02:18] <teward> superguest: you have to boot to the 16.04 livecd to get to its installer.  simply mounting it in the older livecd won't help you
[02:18] <superguest> i only have have one usb.
[02:19] <teward> then go buy a DVD and burn the ISO to the DVD?
[02:19] <teward> or overwrite the usb stick.  or go get another one somewhere, USB sticks are pretty dirt cheap nowadays
[02:21] <superguest> i cannot create a bootable usb, as  the resource is busy, since currently running (old) livecd session is running off the target.

[02:22] <eggggs> install old version  then  install new  if its all you got]
[02:22] <teward> superguest: and you have no other OS to boot to to create the LiveUSB?
[02:24] <superguest> fuck it ill install grub and then loopmount the iso
[02:24] <Bashing-om> superguest: I do not know how it will work out in 16.04 .. but there is : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/ISOBoot <-allow booting/installing an .iso directly from the hard drive.
[02:31] <winston2k> good evening anyone
[02:31] <Nickelback> What key do i have to press to have compiz cube?
[02:31] <Nickelback> I use Ubuntu-Mate
[02:32] <winston2k> do you have compiz config manager installed?
[02:33] <winston2k> need that the settings are there
[02:33] <Nickelback> compizconfig-settings-manager?
[02:33] <winston2k> yes
[02:34] <winston2k> i have mate and i had to install it
[02:36] <winston2k> using compiz desktop cube right now with rotation
[02:37] <winston2k> you have to goto mate tweak and change compositor to compiz before it will work
[02:37] <Nickelback> what do i have to type to have a cube?
[02:38] <winston2k> you need to add workplace switcher to your panel
[02:39] <winston2k> changing workplaces/desktops rotates cube
[02:40] <winston2k> the compiz manager should show you the key bindings
[02:40] <Nickelback> viewport switcher?
[02:42] <winston2k> no, workplace switcher that you add to panel provides multiple desktops
[02:42] <winston2k> right click on panel
[02:43] <winston2k> add to panel
[02:44] <tominator> Could one of you direct me to help for clonezilla?
[02:46] <tominator> where can I get help for clonezilla?
[02:46] <tominator> or info
[02:47] <winston2k> tominator try #clonezilla
[02:48] <tominator> thanks
[02:49] <tominator> I'll try it; I would like to have an EFI boot partition and a regular BIOS partition on the same drive, so that I can move the drive freely between computers
[02:52] <tominator> Can I use clonezilla to copy a drive, but also insert an EFI partition?
[02:55] <Nickelback> the cube doesn't work
[02:56] <teward> tominator: clonezilla does a good job of cloning drives, but it doesn't do a good job of modifying the drive image to add partitions that didn't exist when the image was taken
[02:56] <teward> tominator: however, the channel #clonezilla is better for those types of questions
[02:57] <tominator> teward: Thanks for the info. Nobody seems to be on that channel :P
[02:59] <Barones>  help msg
[02:59] <winston2k> nickelback did you goto matetweak and change compositor to compiz?
[03:00] <winston2k> if you review my steps in sequence they should enable cube
[03:00] <Nickelback> It works!
[03:01] <winston2k> yay
[03:01] <Nickelback> I did it again
[03:01] <Nickelback> i changed the compositor and use compziz again
[03:01] <Nickelback> xD

[03:39] <learner__> hi guys, i'm running ubuntu 14.04 I installed network manager and the pptp plugin, I created a pptp vpn, but when i click to activate it, nothing happens, not even a log in syslog
[03:39] <learner__> what should i do
[03:40] <dirty> repeated question I asked in #ubuntu-server ;; on server how do I manually install security updates on a one time basis, I do not want it automated with unattended-upgrades for a couple local policy reasons
[03:40] <dirty> damn it... s/,/?/
[03:41] <somsip> dirty: http://askubuntu.com/questions/194/how-can-i-install-just-security-updates-from-the-command-line (last suggestion from second answer down)
[03:42] <dirty> somsip: thanks buddy
[03:42] <CloudWalker> my zoneminder cgi scripts work now i think
[03:42] <CloudWalker> but my monitors show red output instead of video feed
[03:42] <CloudWalker> anyone know why?
[03:43] <somsip> CloudWalker: this doesn't seem to be an ubuntu issue - more like one with your scripts or the setting-up of them
[03:43] <CloudWalker> true
[03:59] <Bomber4Chats> If I want to properly install Windows 10 to dual boot with Ubuntu, I should install Windows 10 without UEFI (rather with legacy), right?
[04:01] <dax> Bomber4Chats: it doesn't matter
[04:02] <dax> the main support issue for Linux distros is Secure Boot, not UEFI. theoretically Ubuntu works with Secure Boot enabled, but eh.
[04:02] <dax> apart from that, just install Windows first and Ubuntu second and it should be very simple
[04:05] <SailorMoon> Stupid question, When booting Ubuntu from a Live USB, can i access said USB?
[04:06] <PigeonWhisperer> SailorMoon, yeah it should show up as a mounted drive

[04:18] <stacks88> running ubuntu 14.04 - my server4.mydomain.com , the bandwidth is maxed out. people are downloading directly off its apache. so its doing 1gbit/sec right now.. if i type ssh root@server4.mydomadin.com uptime (to try to run the uptime command without logging in), it just sits there.. stalling forever...... but if i take off 'uptime' and just ssh root@server4.mydomain.com it logs in right away.
[04:18] <stacks88> does anyone know what this means ? it has to do with the bandwidth being maxed out for sure, but why can i log in normally but i cant run commands without logging into this said-box ? Or.. if i do log in normally to server4.mydomain.com , FROM the machine, i cant seem to make outgoign connections to the mysql server. e.g i run mysql -u user -h mysql.mydomain.com -p and after i enter in the pw
[04:18] <stacks88> it just sits there. Simiarily, if i type *from within server4.mydomain.com* : ssh user@mysql.mydomain.com uptime - it doesnt go anywhere. but once i take off the uptime, it logs in.. i feel like theres got to be some setting in /proc or sysctl that i can change, tahts network related, socket related or connection related, to alleviate the situation ?

[06:06] <bigdissaved> and with armagedin on the drive.... I did it last time to 15.4, and it worked for a day, then the graphics did that, with stock vod modules
[06:07] <Bashing-om> bigdissaved: I really do not know with wireless drivers .. DKMS is "supposed" to deal with it .. but ........
[06:08] <bigdissaved> ok, I can do it manually.... and it is easy.... make clean all install, and depmod... done
