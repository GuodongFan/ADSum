[02:57] <daftykins> what is it of? there might be a better way to do what you're trying to do
[02:57] <eddieftwlolz> what do you mean what is it of?
[02:57] <eddieftwlolz> I want to host a game dev tycoon server and the mod is only for windows xP
[02:57] <bazhang> what software eddieftwlolz
[02:57] <bazhang> check the appdb above
[02:57] <eddieftwlolz> software? huh
[02:58] <bazhang> thats what an exe is , yes

[02:58] <eddieftwlolz> nothing for game dev ty cooon that runs well
[02:58] <eddieftwlolz> since im using a mod
[02:59] <eddieftwlolz> and latest version ^^
[02:59] <eddieftwlolz> eerr so I can't ask help for how to run an exe on ubuntu? :P
[02:59] <bazhang> eddieftwlolz, check the appdb, step one
[02:59] <eddieftwlolz> yea I did
[02:59] <bazhang> what did it say
[03:00] <eddieftwlolz> well it doesn't support the latest version of the one I have
[03:00] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Yeah .. seems so .. ok .. let's see if we can get ya booted . Can you boot to the grub boot menu ?
[03:01] <bazhang> step two, /join #winehq for support eddieftwlolz
[03:01] <eddieftwlolz> ok
[03:01] <k1l_> eddieftwlolz: since .exe is not meant to run on linux, your best chance is when wine supports it. if not, well, ask the one who makes the .exe to make a linux one
[03:02] <bihaber> Bashing-om: i am in edit for ubuntu grub entry

[03:27] <hunter> how do i change my username

[03:28] <Spotontoprut> Is there a post or something i can read about installing with encryption such as which program would be best and preferrably support multiple key files?
[03:29] <bihaber> Bashing-om: returns directory contents
[03:32] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Not what I had expected .. "direcory contents" I had expected a list of partitions in the form (hd0,msdosX) . Think'n .
[03:33] <Finetundra> so, I've now tried to install amarok but it won't launch. what gives?
[03:34] <xangua> Finetundra: what gives? you tell us, you tried how? what graphical error do you get? what message do you get when try it on terminal?
[03:34] <xangua> !details
[03:34] <Bashing-om> bihaber: I would accept "diectory contents" from -> ls -lh (hd0,msdos3)/  <- . then we can try and boot to the system .
[03:34] <ubottu> Please elaborate; your question or issue may not seem clear or detailed enough for people to help you. Please give more detailed information, errors, steps, and possibly configuration files (use the !pastebin to avoid flooding the channel)
[03:44] <bihaber> Bashing-om: what now. i rebooted and back in busybox
[03:45] <CsharpCode> if i encrypt my entire hard drive with linux will it slow my computer down.  All i have is a q8200 core2quad that doesn't have AES
[03:47] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Still trying to find out what the partitioning scheme is .. when you got "directory contents" was that from -> ls -lh (hd0,msdos3)/ <- command ?
[03:48] <nicomachus> Has anyone here dealt with the HWE out of support issue?
[03:48] <bihaber> Bashing-om: from -> ls =lh <- only.  full command gives syntax error
[03:51] <Finetundra> xangua, it literally does nothing. heres the terminal output: http://pastebin.com/gHs1e6JH
[03:52] <Bashing-om> bihaber: I am a bit confused .. as that command should have returned partition info .. not directories . How about just -> ls <- . what is that result ?

[03:59] <O_OniGiri> hi there, I am trying to install Ubuntu along Windows 8.1
[03:59] <O_OniGiri> but it doesn't show grub on boot :(
[04:00] <bihaber> Bashing-om: from -> ls <- gives directory contents
[04:02] <Bashing-om> bihaber: are you booting into grub's command line from 'c' at the grub menu, OR booting into the operating system ?
[04:03] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om you talking to me?
[04:03] <bihaber> Bashing-om: booting into operating system.
[04:03] <Bashing-om> 0_0
[04:04] <O_OniGiri> bihaber having same problem as me?
[04:04] <O_OniGiri> bihaber grub not showing on boot?
[04:04] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: not that I am awaare of .. did I ping at ya ?
[04:05] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om nope, but it looked like you were talking about my problem
[04:05] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Shucks .. I lost track .. last I was aware you were booting to a busy box ? So, still not able to boot to the GUI desktop ?
[04:05] <lacrymology> after installing nvidia-331 x fails to start (running 14.04)
[04:06] <lacrymology> if I uninstall it, it works, but.. well, I'd like my drivers, you know
[04:06] <lacrymology> don't really know how to diagnose what's wrong exactly
[04:07] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Sorry, no I was not directing to you .. I know nothing of Win8 or UEFI configs .
[04:07] <Bashing-om> !uefi | O_OniGiri
[04:07] <ubottu> O_OniGiri: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. It is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[04:08] <lacrymology> ah, wait. dmesg says "the nvidia gpu installed in this system is not supported by driver 331"
[04:08] <O_OniGiri> the problem is that grub isn't showing up
[04:09] <bihaber> Bashing-om: can't boot into system from grub. at one point i had a pretty user background after your fix but lost that.  i think my system is sot and i have to figure out how to salvage my files.  i'll NEVER do an Ubuntu upgrade again.
[04:09] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Try: As soon as the bios screen clears press and hold the escape key . does the grub boot menu appear ?
[04:10] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om going to try now
[04:11] <svetlana`> bihaber: from what to what version were you upgrading out of curiousity?
[04:11] <lacrymology> anyone knows why nvidia-319 depends on nvidia-331?
[04:12] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om not working :k
[04:12] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Release upgrades when done properly are not a problem . The thing now is to fix this install .. One can always copy off files from a live(USB)/DVD .
[04:13] <O_OniGiri> Bashing-om during the installation of Ubuntu I recall that it didn't recognize the windows loader,  is that a problem?
[04:14] <bihaber> Bashing-om: where can i go from here? once gub is fixed i still have gui that doesn't work
[04:14] <Bashing-om> O_OniGiri: Sorry, I do not have the knowledge of Win8/UEFI to advise. Await others help .  And yes IF ubuntu did not recognize Windows, there is a problem ( Windows installed UEFI and ubuntu installed CCSM ??) .
[04:15] <Bashing-om> bihaber: If you can boot the operating system, then grub is functional and doing it's job . So the thing now is to find out why the GUI does not start .
[04:18] <bihaber> Bashing-om: grub isn't right. i have to pick ubuntu recovery and then pick a version to boot
[04:19] <bihaber> Bashing-om: i'm not even sure i'm getting the one we built. likely not because the gui doesn't work.

[04:27] <lacrymology> I just figured that the reported device number is wrong. I've installed bumblebee before, which mangles that in order to achieve the switching, I think, but it doesn't seem to be installed now. Any clues what other optimus drivers might I have tried that have been doing this, or how can I check whether there's some module in the kernel that's acting up?
[04:27] <lotuspsychje> lacrymology: bumblebee isnt good anymore, use nvidia-prime instead
[04:28] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: I just said, I don't have it anymore. But there's something that's making my videocard report the wrong ID
[04:28] <lacrymology> it's saying something like 0001.01 or something, and the nvidia driver doesn't recognize it
[04:29] <Bashing-om> bihaber: Too tired to do this any longer .. but the return from -> ls -al /boot } pastebinit <- .

=== Malsasa_ is now known as Malsasa
[04:33] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: it says "display UNCLAIMED" in the first line, product name and stuff seems right, physical id is 0, the only weird thing about it is that the intel card reports physical ID 2, not 1, bus info pci@0000:01:00.0 which I think is the weird ID I had seen in dmesg, everything else seems right
[04:33] <lotuspsychje> lacrymology: you sure you disabled intel card in bios?
[04:34] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: all in all, it looks all right. The intel bus info says pci@0000:00:02.0
[04:34] <lotuspsychje> kk
[04:34] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: I'm sure I *didn't*. I don't think my BIOS supports it
[04:34] <lotuspsychje> lacrymology: normally if you got 2 cards, there should be an option to switch
[04:34] <nukeu666> i keep getting hash mismatch when trying to apt update with trusty security/updates...already tried to clear the var/apt folder but no luck
[04:35] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: also, it worked before updating the distro release (and therefore the kernel)
[04:35] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: and it works under windows
[04:35] <lotuspsychje> lacrymology: maybe its time to re-install trusty clean with internet/updates enabled
[04:35] <lacrymology> lotuspsychje: not all optimus laptops come with a switching-enabled BIOS, don't know why
[04:35] <lotuspsychje> nukeu666: apt-get clean and apt-get update maybe
