[08:25] <boink> and use the xubuntu alternate cd instead
[08:25] <JunkeyWRK> that's a lighter version?
[08:26] <boink> yes
[08:26] <JunkeyWRK> k
[08:26] <boink> no gnome, no bloat
[08:26] <pip> hello,anyone uses stardict ?
[08:27] <unfun> What is the differnce between ubuntu, kubuntu and xubunut, im using ubuntu but I keep hearing about this other stuff.
[08:27] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK: old dells are well known in not showing the live cd properly.
[08:27] <cello_rasp> it
[08:27] <Joakim> And then World of Warcraft is installed!
[08:28] <zniavre> ubuntu is gnome Kubuntu is kde Xubuntu is xfce
[08:28] <boink> kubuntu is using kde
[08:28] <boink> xfce is a much lighter window manager
[08:28] <botxj> yes, hat zniavre said
[08:28] <botxj> what*
[08:28] <boink> I use xubuntu on an old sony vaio laptop
[08:28] <kc76> I guess I forgot my root password. Is their any way to retrive it or reset it. I am using Ubuntu Breezer. I was trying to add users to Samba.
[08:28] <cello_rasp> its the integrated intel graphics at fault. you'll probably need to reconfigure x.org once you have installed ubuntu
[08:28] <JunkeyWRK> cello, you know of ways around the typical problems?  or just try the xubuntu?
[08:29] <JunkeyWRK> ah
[08:29] <cello_rasp> Junkey: install ubuntu or whatever in text only mode
[08:29] <pip> unfun, did you visit ubuntu offical site ?
[08:29] <cello_rasp> gnome should be fine with those specs by the way.
[08:30] <JunkeyWRK> hrm...well...im new to ubuntu/linux...do you have a direct url that walks you through that?
[08:30] <JNeverMind> is there a way to make a keyboard shortcut or else just a shorter string to type in for "sudo shutdown -h now"
[08:30] <JNeverMind> like keyboard shortcut or else make something up like this sudo sd
[08:31] <JunkeyWRK> checkin google...
[08:31] <Homer> does JPG support transparancy?
[08:31] <math_> lol... can somone tell me how to get the userlist in xchat?
[08:31] <math_> its gone :P
[08:31] <math_> Homer, no it doesnt
[08:31] <botxj> JPEG never supported transparency
[08:32] <botxj> only GIF
[08:32] <gOldZahN> hi all! i need some help with my screen resolution
[08:32] <math_> no botxj
[08:32] <math_> not true
[08:32] <math_> gif and png
[08:32] <etsorbme8> using ubuntu 6.06 on a dell d600 laptop will halt on boot up when using the battery, however will boot up fine when connected to ac power
[08:32] <gOldZahN> how can i turn it higher than 800x600?
[08:32] <math_> can somebody tell me how I can bring back the user-list in xchat?
[08:32] <math_> its gone
[08:33] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK: can't find one. Simple way to remember: install in text only.... you will at least get a working system even if the graphics are bad.   Then on install, IF the video is still playing up, go to ctrl-alt-f2, and login. then reconfigure x.org. it shoudl detect the right settings properly
[08:33] <math_> gOldZahN, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:33] <math_> can somebody tell me how I can bring back the user-list in xchat?
[08:33] <math_> its gone
[08:33] <gOldZahN> okaY thX i will try cYa
[08:34] <cello_rasp> JunkeyWRK : what _math said:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:34] <nomin> JunkeyWRK, I think regular ubuntu dapper will run just fine on that machine.
[08:34] <math_> omg... where's my user-list
[08:35] <cello_rasp> yeah, it will be happy with all the desktops. You won't get Beryl or compiz on the integrated graphics card tho...
[08:35] <imsickurdcure> hello
[08:35] <imsickurdcure> can someone help me
[08:35] <etsorbme8> ubu: using ubuntu 6.06 on a dell d600 laptop will halt on boot up when using the battery, however will boot up fine when connected to ac power

[08:37] <imsickurdcure> alright.. i guess i have a lot of reading to do
[08:37] <imsickurdcure> thanks guys
[08:37] <TC`> ubu: i having trouble conecting my win latop throught my ubuntu desktop (with two ethernet cards) to internet
[08:37] <nomin> imsickurdcure, dual booting is pretty straightforward
[08:37] <tenwattmindtrip> Hello everyone.

[08:38] <r00t_> please help me
[08:38] <imsickurdcure> which os should be installed first
[08:38] <nomin> imsickurdcure, are you doing it with one HD or two?
[08:38] <JunkeyWRK> thanks for the info
[08:38] <imsickurdcure> coz i already have win xp installed
[08:38] <nomin> imsickurdcure, you need to install windows first
[08:38] <imsickurdcure> great coz win xp is already installed
[08:38] <imsickurdcure> but i only have 1 hd
[08:38] <imsickurdcure> do i need to partition it?
[08:38] <DARKGuy> Hm, I'm having a trivial problem here... I wonder if any of you can help: I use a script using "import" for taking a screenshot of both X displays (:0.0 and :0.1). Using GIMP for joining the two screens horizontally makes my computer so slow I have to kill the X server -.-'. Is there a way using any CLI command for joining two images horizontally one next to other?
[08:38] <TC`> ubu: i having trouble conecting my win latop throught my ubuntu desktop (with two ethernet cards) to internet, the laptop is conected to ubuntus one etherned card and the other ubuntu ethernet card is onnected to internet with static ip
[08:39] <florent_> imsickkurdcure : yes
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure:  you probably need to shrink the windows partition to make room for linux
[08:39] <imsickurdcure> fat32 or ntfs?
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure, you can only shrink ntfs
[08:39] <imsickurdcure> how do i shrink it
[08:39] <nomin> imsickurdcure, xp is usually formatted in ntfs but it can be formatted into fat32
[08:39] <florent_> fat32 or NTFS : both
[08:39] <JNeverMind> ubu: right on ubuntu fired right up with that new cpu
[08:40] <imsickurdcure> my hd is already ntfs
[08:40] <JNeverMind> and its passive cooling! nice and quiet now
[08:40] <florent_> use Partition Magic or other software
[08:40] <imsickurdcure> any free software i could use
[08:40] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Yeah, gparted
[08:40] <florent_> QParted
[08:40] <nomin> imsickurdcure, in control panel, admistrative settings (or something like that), then disk management.
[08:40] <florent_> GParted
[08:41] <samadhi> tc, have you seen this:  http://news.softpedia.com/news/Share-the-Internet-connection-from-the-command-line-34834.shtml
[08:41] <nomin> imsickurdcure, if I were you I would let windows shrink the ntfs partition
[08:41] <imsickurdcure> ubu: gparted is an ubuntu app or windows?
[08:41] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, If you do the ubuntu install on the hybrid live cd and choose partition when it asks you you'll be fine.
[08:42] <amee2k> hi everyone
[08:42] <imsickurdcure> im sorry im new at this, what is the hybrid cd
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Gnome/linux/ubuntu app, you can get it when you boot off the live cd.
[08:42] <tenwattmindtrip> Can anyone direct me towards information on how to update my BIOS? I have a ASUS K8V bord (AMD64).. I have a ROM to update it, but no clue how to do so in Ubuntu.
[08:42] <nomin> imsickurdcure:  just make sure to back up any data you have before messing around with the partitions.  Something might go wrong.
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, If you got the normal cd then that's what you need.
[08:42] <tenwattmindtrip> board*
[08:42] <florent_> imsickurdcure, why won't you read documentation on the webste ?
[08:42] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Just stick it in and boot off it.
[08:42] <imsickurdcure> yeah, i just downloaded and burned it
[08:42] <wolfgang> hi, i want to install vsftpd, but I can`t run the make -- what`s the problem?
[08:42] <amee2k> which package contains the man pages for libbz2 ? (hint: it is not libbz2-dev)
[08:43] <TC`> ubu: i having trouble conecting my win latop throught my ubuntu desktop (with two ethernet cards) to internet, the laptop is conected to ubuntus one etherned card and the other ubuntu ethernet card is onnected to internet with static ip
[08:43] <nomin> imsickurdcure, which version of ubuntu did you download?  Was it dapper?
[08:43] <RedLance> tenwattmindtrip, You won't update your BIOS from Ubuntu...you'll need to make a DOS boot disk, and on that disk, copy the ROM installer program
[08:43] <imsickurdcure> 6.10
[08:43] <florent_> dapper
[08:43] <imsickurdcure> i think thats the latest
[08:43] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: yes it is
[08:43] <nomin> isn't 6.10 edgy?
[08:44] <florent_> yes, sorry
[08:44] <thevenin> ya
[08:44] <imsickurdcure> lemme check
[08:44] <thevenin> 6.10 == edgy eft
[08:44] <nomin> imsickurdcure, since your new you should download 6.06 which is Dapper LTS  (Long Term Support)
[08:44] <wolfgang> who of you know about installing vsftpd ?
[08:44] <gOldZahN> hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:44] <imsickurdcure> ubuntu-6.10-desktop-i386.iso
[08:45] <imsickurdcure> is that the right version?
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, that'd be fine. just burn it, and reboot with the cd in your drive
[08:45] <nomin> imsickurdcure, 6.10 is the latest version but it's not as stable as 6.06.  I'm using 6.06 now because I'd rather have everything work right without too much tinkering.
[08:45] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, make sure you burn it as an image, and not just put the file on a cd
[08:45] <kandinski> how do I get mouse cut-and-paste support for termianls?
[08:45] <samadhi> TC`, sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 ; sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
[08:46] <kandinski> (for ttys)
[08:46] <imsickurdcure> would you suggest I install 6.06
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> nomin, edgy i very stable at this point, and more polished. that would be the release for a new user who want as much as possible to work ootb
[08:46] <gOldZahN>  hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:46] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: i would but thats all opinion
[08:46] <imsickurdcure> is the 6.10 like a beta?
[08:46] <stefg> xo: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, no, 6.10 would be the best choice for a normal user, imho
[08:46] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: I am in x and glx hell
[08:46] <samadhi> TC`, and then you'll either need a dhcp server (dhcp3-server for example) or set up a static connection on your laptop
[08:46] <nomin> imsickurdcure, I would recommend 6.06 because that one has long term support but people are saying that 6.10 has been better than expected.
[08:46] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, no, its a stable release. just not a lts release
[08:47] <wolfgang> do you know how to install vsftpd`
[08:47] <wolfgang> ?
[08:47] <kandinski> 6.06 worked for me stupendously, 6.10 is giving me lots of frief
[08:47] <kandinski> but ymmv obviously
[08:47] <gOldZahN>  hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:47] <stefg> 6.10 has issues with openoffice, so it's no-go
[08:47] <imsickurdcure> alright, so after i boot with the cd, i'll choos the option "install"
[08:47] <latoo> is there a Beryl repo mirror?
[08:47] <noodles12> if i was going to use a linux to act as a server to replace my router and firewall, would i search under " linux server" or "linux as router" or what is more accurate term for this?
[08:47] <etsorbme8> ubu: using ubuntu 6.06 on a dell d600 laptop will halt on boot up when using the battery, however will boot up fine when connected to ac power
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> kandinski, yes, thats why trying out edgy first is a very good option, imo :)
[08:47] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, yes
[08:47] <DARKGuy> Greetings! I'm having a trivial problem here... I wonder if any of you can help: I use a script using "import" for taking a screenshot of both X displays (:0.0 and :0.1). Using GIMP for joining the two screens horizontally makes my computer so slow I have to kill the X server -.-'. Is there a way using any CLI command for joining two images horizontally one next to other? (I hate to repeat :( )
[08:48] <imsickurdcure> what options should i choose after that
[08:48] <nomin> imsickurdcure, but you can use the apps before installing it just to see what it's like.
[08:48] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: my problem is I upgraded from dapper, which worked, and now I am in edgy, unable to work
[08:48] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: you might not plainly see an option that says install
[08:48] <RedLance> noodles12, I was just on www.howtoforge.com and I say an article on setting up Ubuntu as a gateway server, such as what you want
[08:48] <thevenin> ubu: but you will haft to just hit enter when you se and ubuntu screen
[08:48] <imsickurdcure> will it give me an option to partition or shrink drive c
[08:48] <nolimitsoya> kandinski, as i said, trying egdy first, and reverting to dapper in case of trouble, would be the best aproach for a new user :)
[08:48] <gOldZahN>  hi folks! srY i forgot to save the command you told me to use to get a higher resolution than 800x600. can you repeat it please? thx
[08:48] <noodles12> RedLance: thanks i'll check it out, have you done this?
[08:48] <nomin> on dapper there is an icon on the desktop in the live session you click to start the installation process.  It's pretty straightforward.
[08:48] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: yes it will
[08:49] <Umgan> hola
[08:49] <imsickurdcure> great
[08:49] <stefg> DARKGuy: I'd search the imagemagick docu... or sudo apt-get install 1G-of-RAM
[08:49] <kandinski> nolimitsoya: I am considering the option to go back. but I am still hopeful.
[08:49] <RedLance> noodles12, No, I use coyotelinux as my firewall
[08:49] <latoo> Where can we get Beryl since their drive crashed?
[08:49] <nomin> nolimitsoya, I think a stable release is better for a new user.
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, after booting you will be in a live environment. clicking the install icon on the desktop will give you a wizard, helping you to perform the installation
[08:49] <thevenin> nomin: sorry i didnt know you were talking liveCD
[08:49] <RedLance> noodles12, That's www.coyotelinux.com
[08:49] <strabes> gOldZahN: update your video card drivers and add them into your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[08:49] <imsickurdcure> after the installation, will it give me an option which OS to boot on startup
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> nomin, edgy is a stable release
[08:49] <strabes> imsickurdcure: partitions in linux don't have letter names
[08:49] <DARKGuy> stefg: lol, I tried the info and man pages of imagick... nothing relevant :( and that apt-get needs money which I don't have :P
[08:49] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, yes it will
[08:49] <grimeboy> imsickurdcure, Start installing then when it asks you
[08:50] <arepie> xo: !xorg
[08:50] <ubotu> ubu: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type "sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart" in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
[08:50] <grimeboy> Ahh, clicked enter wrong time
[08:50] <arepie> !3d
[08:50] <nomin> nolimitsoya:  but there are some people who have mentioned problems with it.
[08:50] <ubotu> Sorry, I don't know anything about 3d - try searching on http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
[08:50] <gOldZahN> abes: strabes: thx@strabes
[08:50] <TC`> thanks
[08:50] <imsickurdcure> should I defrag first my drive C before i shrink it
[08:50] <imsickurdcure> or no need
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> nomin, and the same is true for dapper. edgy is a stable release, period.
[08:50] <strabes> gOldZahN: by "them" i meant the proper resolutions.
[08:50] <thevenin> imsickurdcure: not really any need
[08:50] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: yes, defrag first
[08:50] <kandinski> can anyone help me in enabling mouse support for ttys?
[08:50] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, defragmentation is a must if you are planning on resizeing
[08:51] <noodles12> Redlance: is that just a firewall? or does it act as a dhcp server also?
[08:51] <stefg> imsickurdcure: defragging is a good measure... especially if it's ntfs
[08:51] <thevenin> thoreauputic: why may i ask
[08:51] <RedLance> noodles12, It's a firewall, DHCP server and I have it as a proxy too
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, you will be looking as severe data loss if you dont, and having a full backup is always a good idea
[08:51] <w0jtas> hi, i have 5 ips for my servers, do i have to set it in my linux configuration ?
[08:51] <thevenin> i dont defrag before resizing NTFS never gave me any trouble
[08:51] <nolimitsoya> thevenin, good for you :)
[08:51] <RedLance> noodles12, But it won't do file or printer serving, or webpages or anything like that
[08:51] <kandinski> thevein: depends on how full and how old is your disk
[08:51] <imsickurdcure> ubu: quick question, how much drive space should I allocate for ubunto when I shrink drive c
[08:52] <thevenin> no i dont mean it like that, if i can learn something new it would be good
[08:52] <thoreauputic> thevenin: my understanding is that stuff can be isolated on the drive and cause problems - but personally I have only linux here anyway
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, that depends on how much you need. ;)
[08:52] <RedLance> noodles12, And it only needs minimal hardware
[08:52] <noodles12> RedLance: i'm new to this, it says i need 2 PCI network cards?
[08:52] <imsickurdcure> i only have a 40g hard drive
[08:52] <kandinski> thevenin: old disks han be half full but using sectors spread over all the disk
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, minimum 5gb, id say, for / and /home
[08:52] <thevenin> ya
[08:52] <imsickurdcure> will 10 or 15g be good enough
[08:52] <noodles12> i was planning on using my old laptop  but i guess i didn't know what iw as doing
[08:52] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, 10-15gb will be fine
[08:52] <thevenin> but old HD == low capacity
[08:52] <thevenin> so i dont bother with them
[08:53] <RedLance> noodles12, Yes, as opposed to the old ISA cards...as long as your network cards are newer then like 8 years, they should be PCI
[08:53] <nomin> imsickurdcure, 10 gigs should be enough.  Depends on how much stuff you are planning on installing and saving.
[08:53] <RedLance> noodles12, It dosen't support laptops
[08:53] <stefg> ubuntu needs about 4 Gig Minimum, but of course you've got to add space or a separate partiton for your /home-dirs
[08:53] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: 15 g would be better of course :)
[08:53] <imsickurdcure> now, when I boot windows, will windows see that 10-15g or will it be hidden on xp
[08:53] <noodles12> RedLance: why do you need two?
[08:53] <nomin> imsickurdcure, things will be simplest if you tell ubuntu to use LVM.
[08:53] <thoreauputic> imsickurdcure: windows likes to think nothing else exists
[08:54] <thoreauputic> ;)
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> imsickurdcure, if you format with the standard ext3 file system, you can use ext2ifs to access it from windows
[08:54] <nolimitsoya> nomin, i dont think advicing a new user to get into lvm partitioning is a good idea :)
[08:54] <RedLance> noodles12, Well, one connects to the internet, and then the other is what connects to the computers on your side.  That way, they are physically seperated from the net...
[08:54] <St3althy> hey all
[08:54] <St3althy> ubu: i need help installing ubuntu
[08:54] <thoreauputic> +1 re lvm
[08:54] <strabes> St3althy: !ask
[08:55] <strabes> St3althy: !ask > St3althy
[08:55] <nomin> nolimitsoya, why not?  During installation you MUST tell it how to partition the ubuntu installation.  LVM is simpler imho.
[08:55] <Kervan> Hello why i cant see this page with opera : http://www.schroederdesign.com/ahmetaslan/launcher_turk.html
[08:55] <thoreauputic> ie don't use lvm until you are more comfortable
[08:55] <imsickurdcure> ubu: last question, ubunto can run windows apps right? how do i do that
[08:55] <derFlo> hi
[08:55] <nomin> nolimitsoya, that's how mine is now.  I think it's easier, it's just one partition plus a swap.
[08:55] <noodles12> OH. so how would i use my "linux server" to replace my router and only use the old linksys as an access point?
[08:55] <kandinski> imsickurdcure: install wine
[08:56] <strabes> imsickurdcure: the answer to that question is "partially" - use wine
[08:56] <imsickurdcure> from the repository
[08:56] <zspada15> how do i add something to the startup scripts that has to be run with root privelages?
[08:56] <nolimitsoya> nomin, with the ubiquity installer you can just let the installer do all the partitioning and formating decisions for you. that will save a new user loads of time and grief, figuring out how linux partitioning works :) besides, lvm wont save much later trouble in his case, since we are only looking at 10-15gb partitions
[08:56] <RedLance> noodles12, After you set up Ubuntu or Coyotelinux on the "server", then your "server" would connect to your cable modem or DSL or wahtever you have, and then your Linksys would connect to the "server"
[08:56] <noodles12> o0o0o0o0o
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> alright, i'll give this a shot and thanks for your help
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> later
[08:57] <imsickurdcure> :D
[08:57] <mwe> how do you control if sshd is started when booting?
[08:57] <strabes> mwe: sudo apt-get install bum
[08:57] <noodles12> RedLance: for some dumb reason i kept thinking i was going to attach it to the router and not inbetween the router and modem =/ so either way i would need a machine with two network cards
