[14:21] <tomodachi> malimbar: perhaps its not pulseaudio compatible if its old
[14:21] <pbx> arcsky, is it doubled in /run/motd.dynamic too?
[14:22] <malimbar> tomodachi, they're both the ones in the repos for 14.10
[14:22] <pbx> arcsky, i should add that i have no specific ideas, i just ran `man motd` and read a little

[14:31] <loin> hi, is there a easy way to build a executable on a newer ubuntu that will run on older debians? currently it says that my glibc is too old when trying to run on older systems. when i objdump i find out that it uses memcpy from GLIBC_2.14 instead of using the memcpy from an older version. i don't want to use hacks such as __asm__(".symver memcpymemcpy@GLIBC_2.2.5"); in my c code
[14:31] <malimbar> ah, found out why - was using the wrong sound input

[15:12] <Knight80> Hello everyone!
[15:12] <Knight80> Good afternoon from Spain!
[15:14] <Knight80> I've got a problem with my Ubuntu. Whenever I try to browse the network, no windows machines appear. In my home network there are two computers, one with Ubuntu and another with Windows. It used to work fine, but it hasn't worked for a couple of days.
[15:14] <Knight80> Any suggestions?
[15:17] <newuser> how to encrypt any files/folders in ubuntu ?
[15:18] <cfhowlett> !encryption | newuser
[15:18] <ubottu> newuser: For information on setting up encrypted private directories (8.10+) see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory
[15:19] <newuser> cfhowlett: not directories but specific files/folders in any location
[15:19] <cfhowlett> newuser, !  ok
[15:19] <EriC^^> newuser: gpg -c /path/to/file
[15:20] <EriC^^> gpg -d to decrypt
[15:20] <Knight80> I've got a problem with my Ubuntu. Whenever I try to browse the network, no windows machines appear. In my home network there are two computers, one with Ubuntu and another with Windows. It used to work fine, but it hasn't worked for a couple of days.
[15:21] <Knight80> No ideas?
[15:21] <newuser> EriC^^: yea, I wanted to use gpg but I don't know anything about it! so what if I move the files to another computer and do the decrypt then will it work ?? or in a new ubuntu installation on my own system also ??
[15:22] <EriC^^> yeah it'll work
[15:22] <EriC^^> in my experience
[15:23] <EriC^^> newuser: try and see
[15:24] <newuser> EriC^^: how to use the encrypted data on windows ?? and gpg --help shows -e for encryption and -c for encryption with symmetric cipher
[15:24] <EriC^^> newuser: gpg -o /path/to/decrypted file -d /path/to/encrypedfile.gpg
[15:24] <Knight80> Ok, problem solved, thank you.
[15:25] <EriC^^> newuser: gpg -c /file/to/encrypt , will create an ecrypted.gpg file in the same location
[15:25] <Knight80> Updating solved the problem.
[15:25] <EriC^^> newuser: never tried it on windows though... so try it and see
[15:26] <newuser> EriC^^: you mean encrypted.gpg as a password file ?
[15:27] <EriC^^> newuser: no it will create an encrypted file of whatever you encrypted
[15:27] <EriC^^> there's no password file
[15:27] <newuser> ok
[15:27] <EriC^^> you use the same passphrase to decrypt
[15:27] <newuser> ok
[15:28] <newuser> but when and where do I enter passphrase ?
[15:28] <newuser> before encrypting ?
[15:28] <EriC^^> after you type gpg -c /path/to/file
[15:28] <EriC^^> it will ask for a passphrase
[15:28] <newuser> ok
[15:28] <newuser> let me try
[15:29] <newuser> EriC^^: cool...super easy and handy
[15:30] <EriC^^> yeah
[15:30] <newuser> is there any way of decrypting and cracking this ??
[15:30] <newuser> without passphrase ?
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: yes, but it takes a while
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: depends on resources
[15:31] <OpenTokix> newuser: and quality of your passphrase
[15:33] <newuser> OpenTokix: ok but as compared to archive compress and encrypt function how is this gpg method ?
[15:33] <OpenTokix> newuser: as good
[15:33] <newuser> I should be at ease for security then ? OpenTokix
[15:34] <OpenTokix> newuser: Depends what you are protecting against, like someone stealing your computer. - Sure. - Foregin goverment, probably not
[15:34] <newuser> governments for sure otherwise I dont worry about stealing
[15:34] <OpenTokix> newuser: you worry about goverments want your data?
[15:35] <OpenTokix> newuser: And ask about it on #ubuntu on freenode? ....
[15:35] <newuser> lol
[15:36] <teward> OpenTokix: um, that's here.
[15:36] <OpenTokix> teward: Read the whole conversation
[15:36] <teward> [2015-02-04 10:35:17] <OpenTokix> newuser: And ask about it on #ubuntu on freenode? ....  <-- that's this channel
[15:37] <teward> OpenTokix: (I was only commenting on that part)
[15:37] <OpenTokix> teward: ok, don't
[15:38] <teward> newuser: encryption is a multi-faceted thing.  Unless your passphrase on your key is cryptographically strong in relation to the bitstrength on the key, it may be easier for governments / blackhat hackers / malicious threat actors to crack the passphrase on the GPG private key.  However, that private key is needed for decryption.
=== AnalogSmartPhone is now known as NetworkingPro
[15:39] <teward> newuser: if someone has your computer, then they have your private key and can start to try and bruteforce the password for the private key.  Ultimately, this is as good as encrypted ZIP files holding the data, albeit you don't get compression out of the box with the GPG encryption
[15:39] <teward> (unless you compress it and then encrypt the compressed file)
[15:42] <teward> newuser: so long as you keep your GPG private keys in a safe location, you should be relatively OK.  Choosing a cryptographically strong password helps (random letters, numbers, symbols, and punctuation, equal to a character length equal to the number of bytes that your bitstrength corresponds to)
[15:43] <EriC^^> pkzip has a really weak encryption algorithm, it can be cracked in a couple minutes using a plain text attack

[15:44] <jnhghy> is there a way to set a variable in a ssh session on the fly? so after I ssh to my ubuntu to set a variable like $PRINTER="1" and then be able to use that variable while I'm in ssh and after I disconnect the variable to be lost?
[15:44] <EriC^^> it's still used though cause some countries ban strong encryption
