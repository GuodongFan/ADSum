[00:00] <lordcirth> bytefire_, the one that starts with 'DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE' ?
[00:00] <bytefire_> lordcirth: how to update /etc/grub.d/?
[00:00] <bytefire_> lordcirth: i guess so
[00:01] <lordcirth> bytefire_, you make a copy of  /etc/grub.d/40_custom and edit your settings in there.
[00:01] <bytefire_> lordcirth: i see
[00:01] <lordcirth> copy it to, say, 09_custom if you want it to be first.
[00:01] <whitepeter> (clear
[00:04] <bytefire_> lordcirth: so just for my understanding, if `linux` and `initrd` are set correctly in /boot/grub.cfg then it should be able to boot the right kernel?
[00:06] <lordcirth> bytefire_, yes.  But /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated from the settings in /etc/grub.d and /etc/defaults/grub everytime you update.
[00:06] <ShinyShoes> hello?!
[00:06] <bytefire_> lordcirth: i see
[00:07] <lordcirth> ShinyShoes, hi
[00:08] <whim> sigh
[00:08] <ShinyShoes> hey lordcirth! can you help me with my question please?
[00:08] <ShinyShoes> ShinyShoes> Noob here, getting hash mismatch error while updating my repos, deleting /var/lib/apt/lists/* won't fix...any suggestions?
[00:08] <ShinyShoes> i'd appreciate if someone could help me fix this
[00:08] <lordcirth> ShinyShoes, 16.04?
[00:09] <ShinyShoes> 14.04 LTS
[00:10] <elijah> debkad: thanks
[00:10] <debkad> elijah: no problem
[00:11] <lordcirth> ShinyShoes, also try 'apt-get clean' and then update
[00:11] <ShinyShoes> okay, i'll try that as well
[00:11] <Bashing-om> ShinyShoes: Maube a fault in your mirror ? Maybe wait a spell and see if the mirror syncs up with mother .. or change your mirror ?
=== Enzo is now known as Guest56069
[00:12] <lordcirth> Yes, the next thing to try would be switching mirrors
[00:12] <ShinyShoes> still getting error after cleaning
[00:13] <ShinyShoes> this could be the mirror problem, you're right
[00:13] <ShinyShoes> let me change that, thanks for the clue
[00:18] <bytefire_> lordcirth: it still doesn't make sense why the kernel doesn't boot properly on my machine when grub/cfg points to correct image and initrd
[00:18] <bytefire_> grub.cfg**
[00:19] <bytefire_> lordcirth: i have't called grub-update
[00:20] <bytefire_> i'll try and get the exact error this time
[00:21] <zxc_> How do you find and open a file in the same command?
[00:21] <zxc_> That is, in the Terminal.
[00:23] <nacc> zxc_: files themselves don't open -- you open them with something
[00:23] <nacc> zxc_: if you mean to emulate what happens in nautilus, you probaby want `xdg-open`
[00:24] <zxc_> What I want to do is open a music file, using MPV.
[00:24] <zxc_> Piping doesn't seem to work, however.
=== Gabbo is now known as Guest0000001
[00:25] <nacc> zxc_: mpv /path/to/file ?
[00:25] <zxc_> It's deep in the filesystem, however.
[00:25] <nacc> zxc_: what is?
[00:25] <Guest0000001> Hi. Ubuntu 16.04 server. Why did Canonical make the default ethernet names like enp0s25? Where can I read up on the changes and the how any why behind it?
[00:25] <nacc> zxc_: and why does that matter?
[00:25] <zxc_> The audio file.
[00:26] <zxc_> I have to type out the directory every time.
[00:26] <zxc_> I'm thinking of just locating it and then using MPV to open it
[00:27] <Bashing-om> Guest0000001: explanation: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/ .
[00:27] <nacc> zxc_: not sure i follow -- of course you would have to know where the file is to open it
[00:27] <Guest0000001> Bashing-om, ty!
[00:27] <nacc> zxc_: do you not control how your files are created?
[00:28] <nacc> zxc_: oh you mean you want to do `locate ... | mpv` ?
[00:28] <zxc_> I do, but it's in a lot of subfolders.
[00:28] <zxc_> That's what I tried.
[00:28] <nacc> zxc_: dunno if mpv supports that, you should read its manpage
[00:28] <zxc_> Would VLC?
[00:29] <nacc> zxc_: you would to read the manpage, i dont' know
[00:29] <zxc_> Well okay, thanks.
[00:34] <bytefire_> lordcirth: on booting the compiled kernel i get this message which says "unable to find root device" ... and then UUID of partition.
[00:34] <bytefire_> but the older kernel uses same UUID and it boots fine

[03:00] <aaron124> I am trying to create a lightweight linux system that will boot over the network (via PXE) and simply output in the shell the system specifications of the computer it is running on. I don't need to boot to the desktop at all.
[03:01] <orlock> aaron124: run your tool instead of initrd might do it
[03:02] <aaron124> oh really?
[03:02] <aaron124> How do I run it instead of initrd?
[03:03] <aaron124> In my pxelinux.0 config
[03:03] <aaron124> I have the kernel and initrd setup
[03:03] <aaron124> I just want to run a package called "dmidecode"
[03:03] <orlock> change init= to be /bin/bash - but i would test it manually instead of via pxe to start
=== gir is now known as something
=== something is now known as somethingrandom
[03:04] <orlock> aaron124: are you familiar with booting into single user or rescue mode?
[03:04] <aaron124> okay i already have my script ready to go its a bash script and it works as long as the dmidecode package is installed
[03:05] <aaron124> single user i think
[03:05] <orlock> you hit the button when grub appears and change your boot options
[03:05] <somethingrandom> anyone know if there's a way to mount the root file system of an iphone that isn't jailbroken on 16.04?  tech backed up pics from 15.04 to the root directory on a remote client and after updating it's inaccessible
[03:05] <orlock> and set init=/bib/bash
[03:05] <eirikeirikeirik> Hi. How would I write a chown cmd that would recursively go through a directory and it's subdirectories and set owner/group to files ending with a specific file extension and only those?
[03:05] <orlock> or in your case, init=/usr/bin/dmidecode
[03:06] <aaron124> okay your talking about when the live cd is booting
[03:07] <aaron124> i shoudl choose single user mode?
[03:07] <orlock> well, livecd, from hard drive or pxe, it should not matter specifically in the end
[03:07] <orlock> but just for testing whether this method would work
[03:07] <aaron124> okay im going to look for the button
[03:08] <aaron124> I dont see any button actually, i get right to the main ubuntu login
[03:08] <orlock> just change the boot options when you get the grub prompt
[03:08] <aaron124> I see guest session or my user login

[04:26] <galvezjj> apb1963_: I see the system crash window and then it goes right back to the login screen
[04:27] <apb1963_> It sounds like the display manager is crashing?

[04:41] <digimer> Hi all, I'm trying to adapt a script I wrote on Fedora to work on Ubuntu, but I've hit a snag I was hoping I could ask for help with here.
[04:41] <digimer> https://paste.fedoraproject.org/468016/raw/
[04:41] <digimer> I am trying to extract a file from an ISO, but it is throwing that error above
[04:42]  * digimer is not too familiar with ubuntu, so might be missing something obvious
[04:42] <digimer> that above was run as a normal user, not as root or via sudo, in case it matters
[04:43] <digimer> (in fact, I am using iso-read to avoid needing to gain higher access)
[04:43] <Bray90820>  So my cherrytrail surface 3 freezes anytime I watch videos on ubuntu 16.10 and there are a bunch of DMESG errors
[04:43] <Bray90820> http://pastebin.com/raw/U22UbDqr
[04:46] <linxeh> digimer: can you paste the output of ls -al /home/alteeve/Downloads/CentOS-6.8-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso ?
[04:46] <DocPlatypus> Is there any way to get ssh-askpass to ask for TOTP verification codes? I added TOTP verification, and I'm now trying to un-break gvfs-mount access to SFTP

[04:47] <digimer> yup
[04:47] <bonzibuddy> hey folks
[04:48] <digimer> my script tries to extract the files from the ISO without mounting it so that it doesn't need escalated privs
[04:48] <DocPlatypus> bonzibuddy: nice nick... nostalgic for old Windows spyware much? :-)
[04:48] <bonzibuddy> my boot is hanging on eth1 waiting for ipv6.... but i dont have that listed in /etc/network/interfaces, nor networkmanager, to autostart
[04:48] <digimer> if I sudo or mount the ISO loopback, then I don't need to muck with iso-read :)
[04:48] <linxeh> digimer: ok, are you able to mount that iso using loopback? eg auso mount -t loop /home/alteeve/Downloads/CentOS-6.8-x86_64-bin-DVD1.iso /some/directory
[04:48] <linxeh> sirushti: yah, I got that :)
[04:48] <linxeh> err
[04:48] <digimer> I'll verify, but my script md5sums the ISOs to verify they're good before starting
[04:48] <linxeh> digimer: yah, I got that :)
[04:48] <bonzibuddy> where else could it be trying to intialize eth0??  (said eth1 earlier, meant eth0)
[04:48] <digimer> one sec, will verify I can mount loopback...
[04:49] <bonzibuddy> DocPlatypus: ;)
[04:49] <digimer> mounted loopback no prob
[04:49] <galvezjj> apb1963_: looks like it was the nvidia driver, I purged it and now it's running again
[04:50] <linxeh> digimer: you know centos 7.2 is out right? :)
[04:50] <linxeh> (and that 6.8 isn't supported)
[04:50] <digimer> linxeh: yes
[04:50] <linxeh> just checking :)
[04:50] <digimer> linxeh: certain things we need aren't stable enough for our liking on EL7 yet
[04:51] <digimer> anyway, being ubuntu, I suspect that's not an on-topic discussion :)
[04:51] <linxeh> digimer: I take it /home/alteeve/anvil/CentOS/source/Packages/ exists ?
[04:52] <digimer> yup

[04:53] <digimer> excellent, thank you

[05:14] <linxeh> having recently worked on an ISO9660 reader, I do sympathise :p
[05:14] <digimer> if I mount the ISO first, my script runs fine
[05:14] <digimer> so this is the only issue with this stage
[05:14] <digimer> not what I was expecting to get hung up on
[05:14] <digimer> any thoughts on how to diagnose/fix?
[05:16] <Ben64> make a better iso reader, mount it first
[05:16] <digimer> Ben64: if I mount it, I can read it fine
[05:16] <Ben64> yep
[05:16] <digimer> the problem is that I want to be able to read the contents without escalating privs
[05:16] <digimer> iso-read does that
[05:17] <xXEoflaOEXx> hi
[05:17] <digimer> I'm open to other suggestions though
[05:17] <Ben64> yeah i gave you two
[05:18] <digimer> well, option 2 is ruled out because it defeats the purpose, and option 1 is a bit of "throw the baby out with the bath water"
[05:18] <xXEoflaOEXx> When I boot Ubuntu from USB, no matter how many times I try to boot from it it appears the Ubuntu logo, The hard drive activity was on, and off, then repeats (USB not recognized on the front side) until it appears initramfs prompt
[05:19] <Ben64> digimer: then use something like fuseiso9660
[05:19]  * digimer looks into that
[05:21] <cent> My ubuntu runs slowly, how to solve this?
[05:22] <digimer> Ben64: excellent suggestion, thank you

[05:48] <kuwanger> I did an rsync from one SDD to another, and for some reason my ecrypt /home isn't being mounted automatically at login.
[05:51] <server_> Hello. I have a skylake based dell with intel+nvidia graphics cards. The laptop always freezes on startup if I use a regular kernel in grub but if I boot in recovery mode it never freezes on startup.  How can I triage what is different between standard and recover?
[05:51] <server_> recovery
[05:51] <server_> (this happens with all kernels both 4.4 and 4.7)
[05:53] <kuwanger> Hmm..going to try something. :/
[05:56] <galvezjj> I need to boot into text mode and not graphics mode, ctrl-alt-f1 is not working, anyone know how to do that?
[06:04] <maaz_> hello
[06:04] <Elvino> hello
[06:06] <Kuwanger> Okay, just had to boot into recovery and rsync one more time.  Presumably had to do with the user being still logged in causing problems.
[06:15] <b1_xt> here's the deal: I have python3-numpy listed as installed in apt, but python3 doesn't see it and it's not even in dist-packages anywhere, how's that possible?
[06:23] <Netek> I have a new server and I have setup ufw allow my-ip to tcp port 22 and the same for port 21
[06:23] <Netek> I have added 16 IP addresses to the ufw rule for port 21 and 22.  How can I block all IP addresses to access this server on all other ports?
[06:25] <Ben64> Netek: 'sudo ufw default deny incoming' probably, but be careful you don't lock yourself out
[06:25] <Netek> Ben64 I wonder if I already set allow from the IP's I need would this command over write?
[06:25] <Ben64> no
[06:26] <Netek> Ben64 ok, I will see now what happens heh.
[06:26] <Ben64> leave ssh connected, try connecting with a new connection to see if it still works

[06:50] <lawltoad> Hi all. I used to be able to do "xinit -- :1" to start a new xserver but it dosn't seem to work on 16.04. I hear X/rootless X/systemd have changed how things work these days
[06:50] <lawltoad> how do I start a second X?
[06:51] <lawltoad> PS - it crashes with a "EE) parse_vt_settings: Cannot open /dev/tty0 (No such file or directory)"
[06:51] <lawltoad> and now I cant Ctrl + alt + f1 into the other VT consoles
[06:51] <lawltoad> -__-
[06:52] <wedgie> lawltoad: i don't know about your xserver question, but ctrl + alt + FX works for me on 16.04
[06:52] <lawltoad> It worked for me too
[06:53] <lawltoad> until I ran xinit -- :1
[06:53] <lawltoad> which failed
[06:53] <lawltoad> now ctrl + alt + f1 wont work
[06:53] <wedgie> hmm. No idea. Sorry
[06:53] <lawltoad> wedgie, wanna try running xinit -- :1 for me?

[06:56] <lawltoad> Hmm, this may be an issue with 16.04: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2330506
[06:57] <SebthreeBQM10HD> hi
[07:07] <lawltoad> wedgie, I suspect it has to do with the interplay with multiseating
[07:07] <server_> My laptop's external monitor is not well recognized. It is never detected but typically starts as a mirrored monitor and sometimes as an extended monitor.  I want it to always be extended but xrandr and other tools do not properly detect it.  How to fix this?
[07:07] <lawltoad> The prophets were right. systemd is a pain
[07:14] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad, system d hasnt caused any problems for me
[07:15] <lawltoad> Haha, I'm not a hater I swear. I just went from like 14.04 to 16.04 so I suspect alots changed
[07:15] <lawltoad> I actually don't know if it's systemd's fault
[07:16] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad, probably not that much really except for the later versions of this and that and system d
[07:16] <lawltoad> but it looks like if I run "xinit -- :1" not only does it fail, but it makes changing to another VT with ctrl + alt + f1 fail now too. which I didn't think was possible
[07:17] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad, yes init is replaced by systemd
[07:17] <somaReverse> Hi, I've set user ulimit conf in /etc/security/limits.conf
[07:18] <somaReverse> why does it not take effect
[07:18] <somaReverse> pam.d/su has session required pam_limits.so
[07:18] <lawltoad> SebthreeBQM10HD, Yea, I don't mean to start a systemd falamewar. Just tongue-in-cheek. Wanna try starting a second xinit -- :1 for me and see if it fails for you too
[07:18] <lawltoad> ?
[07:18] <lawltoad> did you reboot?
[07:18] <somaReverse> huh?
[07:18] <somaReverse> I did
[07:19] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad, on the tablet so that will be a bit different anyay, and init is gone thats what i mean
[07:19] <somaReverse> i googled for a while and tried sysctl.conf , pam.d , securiy limits.conf
[07:19] <somaReverse> no luck
[07:19] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad,  by having systemd there is no init at all anymore
[07:21] <SebthreeBQM10HD> lawltoad, systemd replaces as in completly removes from distros that use it some of the old things such as init
[07:21] <lawltoad> SebthreeBQM10HD, xinit
[07:21] <lawltoad> SebthreeBQM10HD, its not tied into the old init to the best of my knowledge
[07:21] <lawltoad> SebthreeBQM10HD, startx fails the same way
[07:22] <lawltoad> SebthreeBQM10HD,  know much abotu multiseating?

[08:31] <ducasse> kennyZ: you can look at one of the config-* files in /boot on any ubuntu install of the same version, the image should be using the same kernel.
[08:34] <kennyZ> ducasse: thanks, but in rescue mode there is no /boot directory and also no /proc/config.gz. i think the kernel is in /cdrom/install, but there is no config file

[08:37] <Razva> hey guys! here's an interesting question. I have a home server that has two nics, one is connected to the Internet via PPPoE (eth0), the other one is connected to my home switch (eth1). I've made two VMs, one acting as a router. I've made two bridges (vmbr0 -> eth0 & vmbr1 -> eth1) and connected the router VM to both. the router VM can't use ethX directly, it needs to use a bridge. I've set
[08:37] <Razva> the router VM to use the vmbr0 -> eth0 and setup PPPoE and set vbmr1 -> eth1 as a DHCP server. here's the issue: the DHCP clients can access the internet, but the hypervisor can't. any hints?

[10:29] <dconroy> make sure you unmount first

[10:50] <Pharaoh> Errors were encountered while processing:
[10:50] <Pharaoh>  /tmp/apt-dpkg-install-paj00u/0-opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd_16.40-348864_amd64.deb
[10:50] <Pharaoh>  /tmp/apt-dpkg-install-paj00u/1-opencl-amdgpu-pro-icd_16.40-348864_i386.deb
[10:50] <ducasse> Pharaoh: i thought we arrived at the conclusion you should not use them?
[10:50] <brainwash> ij: you should mention the whole file path
[10:52] <ij> /boot/grub/menu.lst is what I'm talking about.
[10:52] <eka> what's a good screenshot making app?
[10:52] <brainwash> ij: grub is creating that file I'd guess
[10:53] <monomon[m]> eka: i was very happy with Shutter
[10:54] <Pharaoh> ducasse: I thought i had the issues since it never got installed properly.
[10:54] <eka> monomon[m], I was just looking at that... thanks!!
[10:54] <ducasse> Pharaoh: if this is stll on 16.10 then it never will install correctly
[10:54] <Pharaoh> ducasse: anyways, both the devices (GPU) and Intel are unclaimed. How can I force it to choose intel?
[10:55] <ducasse> Pharaoh: that's a bios thing, i think
[10:55] <Pharaoh> ducasse: Thanks, I will not wok on AMD further. I just got some updates from AMD and thought of giving it a try...
[10:55] <mikecmpbll> i don't understand the "-I 127.0.0.1" config option in /etc/default/ntp
[10:56] <TvL2386> thx ducasse I'll check it out
[10:56] <ducasse> Pharaoh: until they update the drivers for 16.10 they won't work, but everything i found yesterday told me you should use radeon...
[10:56] <mikecmpbll> docs say it's the interface that ntp listens on but it's preventing my ntp from communicating with external ntp servers.
[10:57] <Pharaoh> ducasse: Thanks a lot, I will wait for the updates then..
[10:57] <ducasse> mikecmpbll: set it to 0.0.0.0 to listen on all interfaces
[10:57] <mikecmpbll> ducasse : removing it completely has it work correctly, but i don't understand what it's doing
[10:57] <Guest37005> after upgrading from 16.04 to 16.10 chkrootkit gives me "tcpd" INFECTED ,anyone else? false positive or should I wipe my system ,thanks
[10:58] <ducasse> Pharaoh: i would focus on getting radeon working, by filing a bug
=== for{} is now known as ILoveMuppets
[10:58] <Pharaoh> ducasse: Thanks, I will file a bug with them
[10:58] <ducasse> mikecmpbll: me neither, i only use timesyncd now.
[10:58] <mikecmpbll> ducasse : is it saying that the ntp daemon can receive queries and act as a timeserver itself, only on loopback? if so, that sounds like a reasonable default.
[10:58] <mikecmpbll> and i don't know why i have to remove it to allow it to talk to ext. servers :D
[10:59] <mikecmpbll> meh. maybe i'll look at timesyncd

[11:03] <EriC^^> ^ might be useful, still though the error seems important
[11:04] <Guest37005> even if I do apt purge tcpd , chkrootkit still gives me tcp infected
[11:04] <Ben64> why would you purge it
[11:04] <Guest37005> anyone has upgraded from 04 to 10 and could look??
[11:04] <Ben64> i asked you for something already
[11:05] <Pharaoh> ducasse: Thanks again,i filed the bug as you suggested.. using ubuntu-bug linux-image-generic
[11:05] <Guest37005> I don t know the path to tcpd to do md5sum
[11:05] <Ben64> i gave you the exact line to type
[11:05] <Guest37005> ok 1 sec
[11:07] <Guest37005> I have command not found
[11:08] <Ben64> what's the exact error
[11:09] <Guest37005> no command wich
[11:09] <Ben64> so you type that, and it comes back with literally "no command wich"
[11:10] <Ben64> your computer is definitely compromised in that case, time to smash with hammer
[11:10] <EriC^^> which or wich?
[11:10] <hateball> Typing is hard
[11:10] <Guest37005> can you explain a little
[11:10] <Ben64> i asked you for the exact error
[11:10] <ducasse> Guest37005: can you doublecheck what you typed?
[11:10] <Ben64> and if that is what you provided, that is a problem
[11:11] <Guest37005> No command 'wich' found, did you mean:
[11:11] <Guest37005>  Command 'which' from package 'debianutils' (main)
[11:11] <Guest37005>  Command 'wicd' from package 'wicd-daemon' (universe)
[11:11] <Guest37005>  Command 'wish' from package 'tk' (main)
[11:11] <Guest37005> wich: command not found
[11:11] <ducasse> Guest37005: and what Ben64 wrote.
[11:11] <Ben64> great, now try typing it properly. "md5sum $(which tcpd)"
[11:12] <Guest37005> result : bash: md5sum /usr/sbin/tcpd: No such file or directory
[11:12] <Ben64> very close, now without the quotes
[11:12] <ducasse> Guest37005: did you purge the package?
[11:13] <Guest37005> no now it s installed

[11:14] <Ben64> it's fine
[11:15] <Guest37005> surely the upgrade interfered with chkrootkit checking??
[11:16] <Ben64> chkrootkit does false positives all the time
[11:16] <Guest37005> I wish it happened to someone else to be 100$ sure
[11:16] <Ben64> i already said it's fine, so it's fine
[11:16] <Guest37005> thanks
[11:16] <Ben64> it doesn't mean you don't have a rootkit, but tcpd is normal
[11:17] <Guest37005> the fact that I purged it and reinstall it it s bound to be normal, no?
[11:18] <Ben64> possible to have bogus repositories
[11:18] <Guest37005> yes
[11:18] <MorpheusArch> Hey I have a question regarding UCK (Ubuntu Customization Kit)
[11:18] <EriC^^> or some script that switches them every once in a while
[11:18] <MorpheusArch> there is no entry at all on the official wiki
[11:19] <MorpheusArch> is there a way you can put executable shell scripts in the user directory of the newly created ISO file?
[11:20] <Guest37005> another question I had for ages ,if one allows only dns and say http https with iptables ,it means it is absolutely impossible for an attacker to intrude ,correct?
[11:20] <Guest37005> exept hhuman error like running script on pages etc
=== ILoveMuppets is now known as nihilNihil
[11:21] <MorpheusArch> Nothing is absolutely impossible to intrude. But thats a step in the right directory
[11:22] <MorpheusArch> *direction
[11:23] <Guest37005> if only say https is open (443 tcp) ,one can access the system ,like see the file system entering through that port ???
[11:23] <Ben64> possibly
[11:24] <MorpheusArch> If they use https why wouldn't they be able to see the webserver directory?
[11:24] <MorpheusArch> It should only be the webservers serving directory like /var/www/html for apache2 default unless there is some 0-day that allows directory traversal
[11:24] <Guest37005> what webserver ,I m speaking about desktop
[11:25] <Guest37005> trying to secure my ubuntu desktop
[11:25] <MorpheusArch> I thought you meant webserver sorry
[11:25] <MorpheusArch> what ports are opened up on your desktop or the output of sudo nmap -v localhost?
[11:27] <Guest37005> currently only dns http https ,and I open everything out with related traficc in when I use torent
[11:27] <Ben64> Guest37005: the only way to ever be secure is to disconnect it from the internet and power
[11:27] <Guest37005> that s what I feared
[11:27] <MorpheusArch> and what ports are you forwarding through your routers firewall?
[11:27] <s7urmi> "Control is an illusion" ;)
[11:28] <Guest37005> but iptables looks like good control...
[11:28] <Guest37005> I have no forwarding and no router just desktop with firewall
[11:28] <MorpheusArch> It is if its configured correctly, I come from an Arch Linux / Debian background surely SeLinux is available for Ubuntu right?
[11:29] <Guest37005> selinus smells like nsa and they want to intrude more than defend , snowden taught us that
[11:29] <Guest37005> apparmor is a good step
[11:30] <MorpheusArch> its open source...examine before you ./configure && sudo make install
[11:31] <Guest37005> I m not a code savy , and selinux is impossible to examine because of infinite librarys
[11:31] <Guest37005> snowden uses debian :)

[11:32] <MorpheusArch> Such is the nature of most if not all spyware.
[11:32] <Guest37005> wich command network monitor do u use??
[11:33] <MorpheusArch> I just nmap stuff if thats what you mean
[11:33] <MorpheusArch> so nmap there is a GUI version package name zenmap
[11:33] <Guest37005> I m ok with command line
[11:35] <linxeh> selinux is awesome
[11:35] <linxeh> and anyway, you can put it into logging permissive mode and then update the config from there
[11:36] <MorpheusArch> Though you can pretty much do a nmap -v localhost
[11:36] <Guest37005> I use to have it on fedora ,but i m glad ubuntu-debian don t include it by default
[11:36] <MorpheusArch> without nmap
[11:36] <MorpheusArch> Enter this command
[11:36] <MorpheusArch> for i in {1..10000};do (echo </dev/tcp/<insert IP address here>/$i) &>/dev/null && echo -e "/n[+] Open port at :\t$i" || echo -n "."; done
[11:36] <Guest37005> I m sure they have their reasons for not using it
[11:36] <MorpheusArch> It will check for open ports on your current machine that could be exploited by an attacker
[11:37] <MorpheusArch> Dont forget to replace <insert IP address here> with " localhost "
[11:37] <MorpheusArch> or your actual IP address...whichever really
[11:38] <Guest37005> I use a vpn so with my ip you won t reach me
[11:38] <MorpheusArch> I dont want to
[11:39] <Guest37005> I get it
[11:39] <Ben64> Guest37005: you're probably fine. if the nsa cared they'd just hit you with a wrench. don't be overly paranoid
[11:39] <MorpheusArch> I'm simply giving you a command that when entered into the terminal will display your open ports on your desktop
[11:39] <Guest37005> I know my open ports
[11:39] <Guest37005> I m not paranoid ,but as a tor user I m a target
[11:40] <Guest37005> I read the snowden files!!!
[11:40] <Guest37005> every tor use is a potential target
[11:40] <Ben64> as a tor user you're already being monitored
[11:40] <Guest37005> yes
[11:40] <Ben64> anyway this is no longer on topic
[11:40] <Guest37005> yes
[11:40] <Guest37005> thanks
[11:40] <MorpheusArch> As a non tor user your being monitored so what
[11:40] <s7urmi> i like trains
[11:41] <SebthreeBQM10HD> so do I
[11:41] <MorpheusArch> So uhhh nobody got an answer for my question?
[11:41] <s7urmi> which?
[11:41] <ducasse> MorpheusArch: repost, maybe.
[11:42] <MorpheusArch> Well I am trying to use the UCK Ubuntu customisation kit, there doesn't seem to be any entry on the official ubuntu wiki
[11:42] <ikonia> so whats the actual question ?
[11:43] <MorpheusArch> Is it possible to place executable shell scripts in the newly created home users directory
[11:43] <MorpheusArch> I was getting to it Ikonia :P
[11:43] <ikonia> MorpheusArch: you can create users with home directories for sure, so I don't see why it would be a problem to include content in those home directories
[11:44] <MorpheusArch> ok, I know you can do it with archiso (the arch linux version) just double checking before I spend hours customising this ubuntu
[11:44] <MorpheusArch> :P
[11:45] <linxeh> MorpheusArch: yes, you can use skeleton profiles

[11:55] <linux_user> good morning all!
[11:58] <linux_user> I have someone that is running ESXi and wants to do an automated install of ubuntu-gnome but wants to make sure that during the initial install openssh-server is installed also, any ideas how to do that?
[11:59] <MorpheusArch> if tasksel works on Ubuntu auto installs theres probably a way to make sure its checked
[11:59] <MorpheusArch> dont most distros come with openssh as default anyways?
[11:59] <devnull84> pre-launch or post launch config
=== shiva is now known as Guest2249
[12:00] <devnull84> MorpheusArch: yes, it is common
=== icey-travel is now known as icey
[12:00] <linxeh> sadly
[12:00] <linux_user> MorpheusArch: if you mean ssh client yes, ssh server is NOT inclusive to ubuntu-gnome 16.10
[12:01] <linux_user> (by default I mean, it is obviously available to be installed post install)
[12:01] <hateball> linux_user: if they intend to do the customization using esxi/vcenter then vmwares docs probably show how/if you can do that, otherwise there is #vmware
[12:02] <linux_user> what I basically want to do is say to ubuntu-gnome, do a normal installation and oh add this package too...
[12:02] <hateball> linux_user: otherwise you can use UCK to customize what you deploy, or setup something like chef/puppet to handle new deploys
[12:02] <linux_user> hateball: uh, this is an ubuntu question it has little to do with vmware
[12:02] <linux_user> yes, I use ansible
[12:02] <linux_user> but
[12:02] <linux_user> I ansible can do ZERO without ssh server
[12:02] <linux_user> thus I want to be sure that ubuntu-gnome has ssh server on it from the install
[12:03] <MorpheusArch> you may be able to use a function that calls a shell script that just runs sudo apt-get install openssh-server
[12:03] <linux_user> as part of the install you mean?
[12:03] <linux_user> I have to pass the script to the cd or something?
[12:04] <ducasse> linux_user: look into preseeding.
[12:04] <linux_user> if openssh-server is NOT on the system and its running headless that seems rather impossible.
[12:04] <linux_user> ok
[12:04] <MorpheusArch> I was meaning in the installer code add a function that calls and runs the script
[12:05] <lordcirth> preseeding is the correct way.
[12:05] <linux_user> ok
[12:06] <ducasse> linux_user: http://askubuntu.com/questions/122505/how-do-i-create-a-completely-unattended-install-of-ubuntu
[12:07] <linux_user> ducasse: sweet! That look VERY promising!!
[12:07] <MorpheusArch> Why are you using ubuntu gnome if its running headless?
[12:07] <lordcirth> linux_user, you may also want to look into installing an ssh pubkey on the system.
[12:07] <linux_user> I am completely unopposed to doing it that way
[12:07] <MorpheusArch> seems pointless having gnome bloat if its headless doesnt it
[12:07] <linux_user> MorpheusArch: because one can use VNC to use it afterwards
[12:08] <linux_user> its a customer requirement to be there but it likely will not be used
[12:09] <MorpheusArch> You'd be better using x11 forwarding through SSH over VNC
[12:09] <MorpheusArch> especially for remote desktop administration
=== evert is now known as EvertMDC
[12:10] <MorpheusArch> By better I mean not broadcasting the desktop over an unencrypted connection
[12:10] <linux_user> MorpheusArch: thanks but we are digressing
[12:10] <linux_user> I am trying to figure out for now how to do what my customer needs, not change his requirements.
[12:10] <linux_user> ducase: I am going to read your like that sounds like what I need
[12:10] <linux_user> like=link
[12:11] <linux_user> I think doing a full GUI install then command line adding the packages, so I can then get a full list of packages <unconvertable> at the end <unconvertable> is the first step for me also.
[12:11] <linux_user> well
[12:12] <linux_user> actually on second thought, I just need to make sure openssh-server is on the customer ISO and then I can ansible-ize the rest
[12:12] <linxeh> w00t ansible ftw
[12:12] <linxeh> I'm so glad you said that
[12:12] <linxeh> :)
[12:12] <linux_user> ansible rocks
[12:12] <lordcirth> linux_user, yeah, config management is more portable than preseeding, so I'd put the complexity there
[12:12] <lordcirth> I use SaltStack at work, it is also excellent
[12:12] <linux_user> will have to look at that
[12:13] <linux_user> the first step is an iso of ubuntu-gnome that is inclusive of openssh-server being installed. once I do that I am golden with ansible for the rest
[12:13] <linux_user> thank you ducasse, I am off to read and absorb!
[12:13] <MorpheusArch> Im actually in the process of using UCK to create custom ubuntu ISOs
[12:14] <MorpheusArch> maybe you could also create a ubuntu ISO with openssh already installed
[12:14] <MorpheusArch> so you got your own version should a future customer have similar requirements

[12:27] <MorpheusArch> Well if xorg-server is missing dependencies it wont be able to start xorg thus not let you login
[12:27] <mr_boo> my gut feeling says the trashbin had stuff in it that wasn't really trash
[12:27] <MorpheusArch> thats why one of the first questions posed to you was whats the output of xsession errors
[12:28] <mr_boo> the reason i tried to empty trash was that the disk was getting really full
[12:28] <mr_boo> i guess i'll never know what really happened
[12:28] <mr_boo> but anyhow very brutal
[12:29] <mr_boo> emptying trash that totally locks up the system totally
[12:29] <mr_boo> however i was able to recover stuff from live cd
[12:29] <MorpheusArch> welcome to linux
[12:29] <MorpheusArch> :D
[12:29] <mr_boo> with that said it isn't too often i need to reinstall anyway
[12:30] <mr_boo> hope it wont happen again
[12:30] <mr_boo> quite an inconvenience :P
[12:30] <s7urmi> It's not like that is happening to everyone who's trying to flush his trahsbin. Something must went terribly wrong bevor that
[12:30] <tremorcontrol> I had a fresh Ubuntu install, but installed xubuntu-desktop package and started using it, but the indicator for volume and brightness changes is still the purple Unity indicators. Anyone know what application to change/configure?
[12:31] <ducasse> tremorcontrol: i think you need to remove the indicator plugin from the panel.
[12:31] <MorpheusArch> Not everyone blindly deletes files
[12:35] <MorpheusArch> So the moral of the story is, when removing files be careful.

[12:43] <MorpheusArch> you might get a permission denied error sometimes (not this occasion) but yeah you need to mark files as executable before you execute them

[13:02] <rocket__> how to install my printer via usb?
[13:04] <Pwerless> which version of ubuntu is more stable at the moment?
[13:04] <hateball> !lts | Pwerless
[13:04] <ubottu> Pwerless: LTS means Long Term Support. Until 12.04 LTS versions of Ubuntu were supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; since 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) LTS versions will be supported for 5 years on the desktop and server. The latest LTS version of Ubuntu is !Xenial (Xenial Xerus 16.04.1)
[13:05] <imharvey> always LTS
[13:05] <Pwerless> i mean among the LTS ones..which one. some people say 16.04 is still buggy
[13:05] <ioria> !stable
[13:05] <ubottu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should. Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability.
[13:06] <Southern_Gentlem> Pwerless, all software is buggy (anything manmade has faults)
[13:06] <imharvey> 16.04 is great
[13:07] <Southern_Gentlem> Pwerless,  try it and see after all there are 2K linux distros for you to try
[13:07] <Pwerless> yes but asking wont harm
[13:10] <ducasse> Pwerless: 16.04 has been flawless for me, doesn't mean it will be for you.

[13:12] <ducasse> Pwerless: i suggest you just try it. 14.04 has had more time to work out snags, but there might not be any problems in 16.04 either that affects you.

[14:26] <rocket__> the printer is not working nor installed
[14:28] <EriC^^> CIclops: change to a different hwe stack
[14:29] <CIclops> EriC^^, how do I do that?
[14:29] <BluesKaj> CIclops, you should have the 4.2 kernel installed by now
[14:29] <CIclops> BluesKaj, I was never offered it
[14:30] <EriC^^> CIclops: type dpkg -l | grep "linux-image.*lts"

[14:36] <expertninjaa> How do I install kernel 3.16 on ubuntu 16.04 server
[14:36] <ikevin> you maybe need to compile it yourself

[14:39] <s7urmi> getting back to my "Learn Linux" question. I recently used the codecademy bash course to refresh, check my bash skills and liked the interactive way of it. Do you guys know something similar? I know i could just use an VM or so and play around but i like to get a bit more guided :)
[14:40] <EriC^^> ikevin: it doesn't really have many dependencies, how well it would fit in with everything else in the system is another thing though
[14:40] <EriC^^> expertninjaa: why do you want 3.16 anyways?
[14:41] <tomreyn> expertninjaa: downgrading the kernel to a lower version than the release is probably not a good plan. why do you need the lower version?
[14:42] <expertninjaa> the backup service that we use across all our systems only supports up to 3.16 currently
[14:42] <EriC^^> s7urmi: there's a nice interactive guide on vim on the web somewhere, fwiw
[14:42] <tomreyn> expertninjaa: hmm, what kind of backup service is this? it should not need to interface with the kernel really.
[14:42] <expertninjaa> I attempted to get the network engineer to agree to install 14.04 instead of 16.04 for reasons like that
[14:42] <CIclops> EriC^^, so far so good now I have 4.4.0-45-generic #66~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Wed Oct 19

[14:44] <s7urmi> Eric^^: u mean http://www.openvim.com/ ?
[14:44] <EriC^^> CIclops: they all start with linux-image and the one linux-generic-lts-vivid
[14:45] <EriC^^> s7urmi: yeah that's the one

[14:46] <s7urmi> EriC^^: k, i'll check it out, many thanks again
[14:46] <CIclops> EriC^^, do I need to do remove the  lts-vivid metapackage and related kernels or can I just continue now?
[14:46] <tomreyn> expertninjaa: oh so the idea is that the kernel pushes a message to the application when files are modified / created / deleted, i guess. you  could achieve the same with incron or similar, but i guess you need to use this specific / existing solution. if i was in this situation, i would just install and run an older ubuntu lts release instead (which is still supported).
[14:47] <EriC^^> CIclops: yeah remove them
[14:49] <EriC^^> s7urmi: no problem
[14:49] <tomreyn> expertninjaa: i.e., install trusty, and select backports as available from the official backports repository and non-official PPAs
[14:51] <expertninjaa> tomreyn:  I suggested that to my manager, but the official answer is "we will just do backups the old fashioned way"
[14:52] <tomreyn> this said, a backup solution which depends on a custom built kernel module and kernel version is about the worst i've heard of so far (and i've run into several and most of them are already terrible in one or the other way).
[14:52] <expertninjaa> e.g. setting cron jobs to image the servers
[14:52] <paws> i had eth1 network interface but i disconnected it from my ubuntu vm.. now my ubuntu keeps going to emergency mode and it saying that is looking for eth1 how can i completely remove eth1 from my system?
[14:52] <expertninjaa> well, if you saw how fast it was, you would be pretty damn impressed
[14:52] <paws> I just removed the network adapter from my esxi
[14:52] <expertninjaa> when it works it works AMAZINGLY well
[14:53] <expertninjaa> but I guess they are struggling to get support for newer kernels
[14:53] <paws> i mean i removed the eth1 via the vsphere client
[14:53] <expertninjaa> anyways, thank you all
[14:53] <tomreyn> until a new kernel version becomes commoon.

[14:54] <EriC^^> CIclops: ok, remove all 3 using apt-get purge

[14:54] <CIclops> k
[14:56] <CIclops> EriC^^, just apt-get purge?

[15:05] <s7urmi> didier: sorry, with some more information about what you want to know, there's likely someone who'll answer you
[15:05] <EriC^^> ubiquity
[15:05] <Guy1524> because I was thinking, wouldn't it be possible to run this in windows, and for windows users switching to ubuntu, just run the installer from windows and reboot and it would be installed you know?
[15:05] <OerHeks> Guy1524, lolz, no.
[15:06] <Guy1524> OerHeks: why not?
[15:06] <brainwash> !wubi
[15:06] <ubottu> Wubi was a way to install Ubuntu from within Windows, but it is no longer supported in recent versions of Ubuntu and Windows, and was never well maintained even for Ubuntu 12.04. Do not use Wubi. See !install for other options for installing Ubuntu.
[15:06] <drkjstr> saint_: Did you checksum the ISO? Sometimes that can be the issue. I know I have successfully installed Ubuntu on ESXi 3.5, 4.0, and 5.5 without any special changes.
[15:06] <nacc> Guy1524: it's not a windows executable
[15:06] <OerHeks> Guy1524, just saying you cannot
[15:06] <Guy1524> oh, never seen wubi
[15:06] <Guy1524> thats cool
[15:07] <EriC^^> Guy1524: it would need to be heavily modified and rewritten
[15:07] <brainwash> Guy1524: cool, but not supported anymore :/
[15:07] <EriC^^> you could make something like that, or anyone if they really wanted i guess
[15:07] <Guy1524> why, just run qemu and use hardware passthrough for all the drives
[15:07] <Guy1524> it wouldn't need that much change would it
[15:07] <EriC^^> well that's using qemu
[15:08] <OerHeks> qemu =!windows
[15:08] <nacc> which basically ignores that its windows
[15:08] <Guy1524> so?
[15:08] <Guy1524> the end user wouldn't notice a difference
[15:08] <OerHeks> Guy1524, go try your suggestion then.
[15:09] <Guy1524> ok
[15:09] <Guy1524> I don't know python though ):
[15:09] <Guy1524> only c++/some java
[15:09] <Guy1524> Ill be back in a few months to tell you how it went :P

[15:47] <EriC^^> !persistence | spitzi
[15:47] <ubottu> spitzi: To have some persistent storage when using a Live CD, follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
[15:47] <popMaize> spitzi, if you use usb_creator, there is a checkbox IIRC for using additional space as storage
[15:49] <spitzi> popMaize: Yeah, but it limits me to 4GB
[15:49] <irgendwer4711> where to file a bug for handbreak?
[15:50] <spitzi> Like, why not just offer to use the USB as the root file system while "trying" Ubuntu
[15:50] <ducasse> irgendwer4711: did you install it from the ubuntu repos?
[15:50] <irgendwer4711> yes
[15:51] <brainwash> irgendwer4711: https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues
[15:51] <irgendwer4711> brainwash: I dont use the github version
[15:51] <ducasse> irgendwer4711: then you can file a bug with 'ubuntu-bug handbrake' and filling out the page it opens in your browser, but you may be told to file it upstream. depends on the bug.
[15:52] <irgendwer4711> ducasse: somehow after upgrading to 16.10 the handbreak window is to wide and some setting buttons are to small.
[15:52] <spitzi> I'll give this a go: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[15:53] <ducasse> irgendwer4711: i'm guessing that is because of gtk 3.20, file it the way i explained.
[15:53] <irgendwer4711> ok
[15:54] <irgendwer4711> ducasse: funny, it told me, that handbreak was not installed :-D

[15:57] <irgendwer4711> ducasse: yes, the correct name is 'handbrake-gtk' but it seem no to be from Ubuntu?!
[15:58] <ducasse> irgendwer4711: that's most likely from a ppa, the ubuntu package name is 'handbrake'.

[16:11] <irgendwer4711> another question: did ubuntu 16.10 change behavior on too small input fields?

[16:38] <ducasse> brunch875: wouldn't be 'development branch' if it was :)
[16:39] <OerHeks> brunch875, no, after testing in proposed it might become stable.
[16:40] <brunch875> I'm asking this because I'm on rc-proposed on ubuntu touch and I didn't have any major issues which prevented me from using the phone, only irksome bugs which I'd report
[16:40] <brunch875> So I was wondering if there was also some sort of rc-proposed ubuntu which was more cutting edge, with irksome bugs and yet good enough for daily use
[16:41] <OerHeks> brunch875, you better reask in #ubuntu-touch, updates there go by OTA
[16:41] <Promille> brunch875: It's development so you should never assume that its stable. But speaking from experience most stuff can be rather stable.
[16:41] <ducasse> brunch875: are you asking about -proposed or zesty? proposed might be what you want, but it's mainly for testing purposes.
[16:41] <Jordan_U> wabbits: You're welcome.OB
[16:42] <Jordan_U> wabbits: Since you haven't joined it yet, ##hardware is the channel you're looking for. "/msg alis list hardware" would list it, but "/msg alis list pc hardware" would not.

[16:43] <brunch875> after all, I'm using ubuntu for free

[16:49] <nacc> xcy: no, mpd-client is a 'provides' from several pacakges

[16:49] <xXEoflaOEXx> xcy: This package is not in an official repositories

[16:59] <ILoveMuppets> i use ubuntu 16.10
[16:59] <chars6> can someone tell me if apt-clone copies configs for installed apps too, like say apache's config as an example?
[16:59] <OerHeks> chars6, no. just the .deb packages.
[16:59] <ducasse> ILoveMuppets: see 'man xset', the 'dpms' and 's' options.
[17:00] <chars6> thanks OerHeks
[17:01] <ILoveMuppets> ducasse, i want to set a timeout, not to turn off the screen
[17:01] <chars6> would there be any risk in just copying over /etc from a ubuntu install to kubuntu of the same version?
[17:01] <OerHeks> chars6, kubuntu and ubuntu uses the same repos, so the answer is no
[17:01] <ducasse> ILoveMuppets: that's what 'xset dpms ...' does.
[17:02] <ILoveMuppets> man, show me the command args/options for i have found nothing
[17:04] <ducasse> ILoveMuppets: "When numerical values are given, they set the inactivity period (in units of seconds)  before the three modes are activated.  The first value given is for the `standby' mode, the second is for  the  `suspend'  mode, and  the  third is for the `off' mode."
[17:04] <chars6> OerHeks: so after running apt-clone, if i want to copy over any and all config stuff, are there/which other directories will i want to copy?
[17:04] <chars6> or is just /etc enough?
[17:04] <doppler1> :-D
[17:05] <OerHeks> chars6, apt-clone does nothing with configs, you need to copy them manually
[17:05] <ILoveMuppets> ducasse, ill look into it
[17:06] <OerHeks> ILoveMuppets, maybe this page is any help http://askubuntu.com/questions/430384/turn-screen-off-when-inactive-setting-from-terminal
[17:06] <chars6> OerHeks: yes, i'm asking what directories beyond /etc i'll want to copy?

[17:24] <EriC^^> daum: install the headers for the kernel
[17:25] <EriC^^> apt-get install linux-headers-generic
[17:25] <daum> EriC^^, pretty sure i did when i installed it?
[17:25] <daum> installing
[17:25] <RFleming> apt install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[17:26] <daum> EriC^^, it looks like it install 4.4.0.45.48 headers however i'm on 4.8
[17:26] <RFleming> daum: apt install linux-headers-`uname -r`
[17:26] <EriC^^> daum: are the 4.8 headers installed? try dpkg -l | grep linux-headers
[17:26] <ducasse> daum: apt-get won't find the heasers if the kernel is not from a repo with the headers
[17:26] <RFleming> will install the headers for the kernel you're currently running
[17:26] <xXEoflaOEXx> daum: How did you get the 4.8? Official repos?
[17:27] <ILoveMuppets> i ended up using 'gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.session idle-delay 300'
[17:27] <AnonyFox> how do i see hidden files in terminal ?

[17:27] <OerHeks> daum how did you insall 4.8 on xenial 16.04?
[17:27] <ducasse> AnonyFox: 'ls -a'
[17:27] <daum> xXEoflaOEXx, no- didn't know i could get it from them, it was from something similar to: https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/install-linux-kernel-4-8-ubuntu-16-04-16-10
[17:28] <daum> EriC^^, yep they show as installed from that command
[17:28] <OerHeks> manually .. get the headers manually too
[17:28] <EriC^^> daum: maybe try reinstalling the virtualbox-dkms package
[17:28] <daum> EriC^^, ok will try
[17:28] <RFleming> daum: you're going to have to download the headers from the same place you downloaded the kernel
[17:29] <xXEoflaOEXx> daum: Do you have the linux headers 4.4 or 4.8?, If 4.4, Download these headers, also What kernel version 4.8.x?
[17:29] <RFleming> best place to get them is from the kernel.ubuntu.com PPA
[17:29] <daum> i have both installed it looks like, linux-headers-4.4.0-45, and linux-headers-4.8.0-040800, both with -generic also
[17:30] <daum> RFleming, so should i try to add that PPA and reinstall them?

[17:33] <EriC^^> Julz: which program? what does the readme say?
[17:34] <daum_> should i try to install a kernel from the ubuntu ppa rather than the one i found from the mainline?
[17:35] <Julz> It is GNUspeach and here is the readme file: http://pastebin.com/gxRS1PLW
[17:36] <Pici> Julz: that software looks like it is for MacOS.
[17:37] <Julz> Pici they say on their website they wanna provide HQ text output for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and other platforms
[17:38] <kevdog_> Why are you upgrading kernels?
[17:38] <ducasse> Julz: they might mean 'want to' as 'in the future'. that software needs xcode to build.
[17:38] <xXEoflaOEXx> daum_: It looks like 4.8.0-040800 in VirtualBox-DKMS 5.0 is not supported
[17:39] <daum> xXEoflaOEXx, just curious how did you find it?  Maybe I should update to 5.1 then if it is supported there?
[17:40] <algo> hey there, i wanna ask about the ubuntu-restricted-extras
[17:40] <Julz> Nevermind I am sorry. I tried for 1.5 hours installing the MacOS version. Got now the right one
[17:40] <xXEoflaOEXx> daum: Updating to VirtualBox 5.1 requires Yakkety upgrade
[17:40] <daum> xXEoflaOEXx, looks like i can get it in xenial: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads

The global menu, on my laptop I can "switch" to other menus if one is open by hovering with the mouse over the entries. On my pc I cannot do that, I have to click on each menu item to open it, which is very annoying. Any idea what could cause this / how to fix?

[19:07] <fgxadmin> exactly! i hate needing windows for these adobe products i really wish my clients would get off this bandwagon...
[19:08] <craigbass76> fgxadmin: I can't remember if it was after a WIndows update, or a newer Mint, but it crapped out a few months ago. I found win-sshfs and can now map one of my Linux drives on the Windows box
[19:08] <fgxadmin> ok I'm going to look into "win-sshfs" thanks for the push in any direction....
[19:09] <Mathisen> fgxadmin, one solusion would be to just chmod 777 the share.. but that is not the best solusion but should work
[19:11] <fgxadmin> ogm 777 figures to make windows work, every way you turn with windows you seem to have to play with fire ;)
[19:11] <ppf> fgxadmin: what's the share shared between?
[19:11] <ppf> vm and host?
[19:12] <fgxadmin> yes, and the VM is running on the host ;) thats the funny part
[19:13] <Mathisen> virtualbox atleast you can just use the shared clipboard to just copy files between then
[19:13] <ppf> using actual samba or virtualbox shared folders?
[19:13] <drkjstr> fgxadmin, becareful, the win-sshfs project is somewhat abandoned. You will need to use this project: https://github.com/Foreveryone-cz/win-sshfs/releases
[19:14] <drkjstr> As well as the latest Dokan DLL.
[19:15] <fgxadmin> no simply have a samba with a share for my clients folder on host, open windows7 VM on same host and share works, shows files reads files, can copy/paste on W7 explore "if i an not overwriting files" but if i open a app and try to open edit and save, craps out...."
[19:15] <ioria> AnonyFox, no, sorry less works ( i selected the wrong file) ... idk  why it wasn't working for you

[20:13] <mbwe> ehm, that is not possible, since i am not behind the keyboard but remotly connected over ssh
[20:13] <ppf> Welastevil: please tell us first what you did?
[20:13] <ioria> mbwe,  click on NM icon in the panel and 'Connection Informatio' will tell you your dns
[20:13] <ziox> Hello, is it possible to use usb stick 1tb and make it persistant to ubuntu ?
[20:13] <mbwe> but /etc/resolv.conf is pointing to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in otherwords google dns
[20:13] <ppf> there's no sense in us guessing what you did from you listing us random symptoms of single commands not working as intended
[20:13] <ioria> mbwe,  ok   cd in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
[20:14] <ducasse> linux137: wget has --no-proxy, use that instead of curl.
[20:14] <Welastevil> knowgrep -i "remove.*gnustep"/var/log/apt/history.log

[20:15] <EriC^^> where did you get know from? :D
[20:15] <linux137> > ducasse yes but if i need to send POST data i can't with wget

[20:24] <SimonKLB> could anyone tell me how the nvidia drivers are loaded during init? ive removed all traces of it from modprobe.d and generated a new initramfs but they are still loaded
[20:24] <MonsieurBon> I have a very restrictive iptables policy on my server (drop on incoming and outgoing). To find out if I'm blocking something important, I'm logging all dropped packages. I see a lot of logs from port 80 to port 80 at some ip address I don't know. Is there any way of finding out what process is trying to make the connection=
[20:24] <MonsieurBon> ?
[20:25] <ioria> SimonKLB, lspci -k | grep VGA -A 3
[20:26] <akik> MonsieurBon: sudo lsof -i TCP:80
[20:26] <SimonKLB> ioria: yea?
[20:26] <akik> MonsieurBon: also netstat
[20:26] <ioria> SimonKLB, lspci -k | grep VGA -A 3
[20:27] <akik> MonsieurBon: netstat -tulpan (-p) will show the process info
[20:27] <SimonKLB> ioria: https://paste.ubuntu.com/23417768/
[20:28] <ioria> SimonKLB, sli ?
[20:28] <SimonKLB> ioria: no
[20:28] <ioria> SimonKLB, you got two nvidia ?
[20:28] <SimonKLB> ioria: yes, im trying to use the second one with gpu passthrough using vfio-pci
[20:29] <ioria> SimonKLB,  sudo lshw -C Video
[20:29] <MonsieurBon> akik, http://paste.ubuntu.com/23417774/ the 141.138.130.* addresses are the ones I'm interested in.
[20:29] <SimonKLB> ioria: https://paste.ubuntu.com/23417778/
[20:30] <akik> MonsieurBon: you can ask a whois server who owns them
[20:30] <ioria> SimonKLB,  amazing ... how did you removed nvidia ?
[20:30] <irgendwer4711> hi, after upgrading to 16.10 my Wine-Programs disappeared in start menu. how to get them back?
[20:31] <SimonKLB> ioria: i deleted the conf files from modprobe.d and there are nothing loading nvidia in modules-load.d either
[20:31] <SimonKLB> what other places could you define modules to load during init?
[20:32] <ioria> SimonKLB,  usually to remove nvidia , is sudo apt-get purge nvidia ... i never heard deleting config files ....
[20:32] <SimonKLB> ioria: yea of course, but i need the nvidia drivers for my main card
[20:32] <EriC^^> SimonKLB: if you want them not to load you can blacklist them
[20:32] <ioria> SimonKLB,  sorry, sudo apt-get purge nvidia*
[20:32] <SimonKLB> EriC^^: yea tried that too, still loads, its amazing
[20:33] <EriC^^> SimonKLB: something else is loading that needs it so it's loading it too
[20:33] <ioria> SimonKLB,  you want nvidia only for one device ?
[20:33] <SimonKLB> ioria: yes
[20:33] <ioria> SimonKLB,  mytic
[20:33] <EriC^^> SimonKLB: lsmod | grep nvidia should show what depends on it too
[20:33] <SimonKLB> im pretty sure it would work out if i could load the vfio modules before the nvidia modules
[20:34] <EriC^^> SimonKLB: maybe use /etc/modules to load the vfio modules?
[20:34] <EriC^^> that loads them pretty early on i think
[20:34] <SimonKLB> EriC^^: tried that, still loads after unfortunately
[20:35] <SimonKLB> i can see that drm and drm_kms_helper requires nvidia, ill check if they are specified somewhere
[20:35] <MonsieurBon> akik, seems to be williamhill.co.uk which is very suspicious. I wouldn't know what would be connecting there...
[20:36] <SimonKLB> # grep -Ri drm /etc/mod*
[20:36] <SimonKLB> *nada*
[20:36] <SimonKLB> really odd
[20:36] <ioria> SimonKLB,  maybe you need  a xorg.conf
[20:37] <ioria> SimonKLB, and load nouveau for the 2 <unconvertable>  ... (just thinking)
[20:37] <SimonKLB> ioria: doesnt x stuff happen after init though?
[20:37] <ioria> SimonKLB, sure
[20:38] <SimonKLB> in dmesg:
[20:38] <SimonKLB> [    2.530928] nvidia 0000:07:00.0: enabling device (0100 -> 0103)

[20:38] <SimonKLB> even though vfio_pci is added to /etc/modules
[20:40] <SimonKLB> dracut have a cmdline option rd.driver.pre which should force some modules to load first, is there something similar i can use in ubuntu?
[20:41] <ioria> SimonKLB, above my paygrade
[20:41] <josuebc> Hi there. I have an ESC/POS printer which appears under /dev/ttyAMC0. I can send some raw data doing something like `echo "raw data" > /dev/ttyACM0` and it prints. I then added the printer doing `lpadmin -p thermal -v serial:/dev/ttyACM0` and added my user to dialout group. Now when trying to print something using `lpr -r -l -P thermal to_print.txt` I get a "Unable to open serial port: Permission denied" error. Any idea why?
[20:42] <Ben64> josuebc: you might need to reboot for the change in group membership to take effect
[20:42] <josuebc> Ben64: Already done that.
[20:42] <ppf> SimonKLB: did you install cuda?
[20:43] <akik> MonsieurBon: did you see which application is making the connections?
[20:43] <niytro> hi all =) just wondering how to install QuickTime and Adobe Acrobat Reader plugins for chromium? I need to do an online course
[20:43] <SimonKLB> ppf: not that im aware of, its possible if its bundled with nvidia somehow
[20:44] <SimonKLB> dpkg -l | grep -i cuda gives me nothing though
[20:44] <ppf> dpkg -l '*cuda*'?
[20:44] <ppf> ah, yea that should yield about the same
[20:44] <MonsieurBon> akik, seems to be apache2 but that still leaves me clueless... I'm wondering if I should open the connection and run tcpdump to see what's going on, but that's maybe a bit risky...
[20:44] <ioria> SimonKLB,  http://superuser.com/questions/956868/ubuntu-box-with-multiple-nvidia-graphic-cards
[20:45] <ppf> what's it exactly that you want? (sorry i missed most of the conversation)
[20:45] <SimonKLB> ppf: i have two nvidia cards, i want to use the secondary one for gpu passthrough in a vm
[20:45] <SimonKLB> the problem is that the nvidia driver is claiming both of them during init
[20:46] <SimonKLB> i think forcing vfio to load before nvidia will fix it
[20:46] <SimonKLB> but im unable to do so
[20:46] <apetiss> Any recommendations to an calendar app? (needs to be able to sync w google calendar)

[20:48] <ioria> SimonKLB,  in particular this 'Create VFIO config files '
[20:48] <ppf> don't blacklist the driver, blacklist the card's pci address
[20:48] <SimonKLB> ppf: didnt know you could that, please do tell!
[20:49] <SimonKLB> ioria: not that one specifically, but ive read a lot of similar articles

[20:50] <ppf> SimonKLB: it's from the link ioria posted
[20:50] <SimonKLB> ah you mean through pci_stub?

[20:57] <Delphin2> ppf: where would they be?
[20:57] <MonsieurBon> akik, am I right, that I should not see any packages in tcpdump when they are dropped by iptables?
[20:57] <ppf> you sure you're booting the right kernel?
[20:57] <SimonKLB> ppf: no worries, im giving dracut a try now, wish me luck :D
[20:58] <SimonKLB> ppf: yea, ive though of that as well hehe
[20:58] <ppf> Delphin2: depends on what the problem is
[20:59] <SimonKLB> ppf: it actually worked haha

[21:02] <confusius> good evening, folks. I am in need of assistance regarding m encrypted disk (on debian8 though...). What happened was (this is a full encrypted debian , encrypted with LUKS from the alternative installer) I booted up yesterday and debian reverted back to some default wallpaper but also did not accept my keystrokes anymore in a proper way (when typing a letter it would add an "s" in front of it)
[21:02] <confusius> so I rebooted, but got a "no key with this passphrase available", on internal (laptop) and different USB keyboards / different USB port

[21:05] <MadDash> hi
[21:05] <akik> MonsieurBon: i'm not sure about tcpdump question. you can block outgoing connections to www.williamhill.com (example) with: sudo ufw deny out from any to 141.138.130.12
[21:05] <MonsieurBon> akik, so I think the packages origin is actually from the outside as I'm seeing a lot of traffic in tcpdump to and from this address. The only thing I see is SYN and ACK packages though... I wonder why iptables is dropping the packages, as I have alowed related,established for both incoming and outgoing connections...
[21:06] <akik> MonsieurBon: could it be advertisement traffic?
[21:07] <akik> MonsieurBon: or if william hill is running a web crawler that hits your site
[21:09] <MonsieurBon> akik, I don't have a website with ads on it. And that traffic would go from the users browser directly to the ad server, right? I will block the IP range for icoming traffic on port 80 and see what happens. Still wondering, why the outgoing packages are being dropped...

[22:23] <mundus2018> OerHeks, Can you help me find it
[22:25] <OerHeks> mundus2018, find what? [Radeon HD 5770] is not going to work with the AMD gpu driver
[22:25] <mundus2018> You said radeon open driver
[22:25] <mundus2018> where can I find that?
[22:25] <OerHeks> yea, that should be default now on 16.04/16.10
[22:26] <mundus2018> Hm
[22:26] <mundus2018> Im on 16.10

[22:30] <cdorsal> anyone in here a udp expert?
[22:31] <lordcirth> !ask | cdorsal
[22:31] <ubottu> cdorsal: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[22:31] <mundus2018> Bashing-om, okay so your saying its installed?
[22:31] <mundus2018> and if so, do you have any idea why it is not detected with OpenCL?
[22:31] <cdorsal> @lordcirth I'm running an application on a windows machine that is connected directly to an ubuntu system over ethernet
[22:32] <cdorsal> @lordcirth I can see udp multicast packets being sent out, but using wireshark or tcpdump I cannot view te udp traffic
[22:33] <cdorsal> @lordcirth the windows system is sending udp packets via subscription to 239.X.X.X
[22:33] <cdorsal> @lordcirth if I go from windows -> windows I can see the udp traffic on both ends without doing anything fancy.
[22:34] <erkules_> ahoi I installed 16.04 and now im missing a keyboard layout like "us,international with dead keys". But I would like to have *no* dead keys. But can't find any in the "Text Entry" Widget
[22:35] <lordcirth> cdorsal, if you run 'netstat -g' does your multicast group show up?
[22:36] <cdorsal> @lordcirth yes it does
[22:36] <ponies> Has anybody ever used Compiz Config Settings Manager to configure Unity and walked away with positive results?
[22:37] <cdorsal> @lordcirth I have tried routes, iptables, smcroute, pimd without any success but if I use a udp packet sender with the ip address of mu ubuntu target, it works everytime, but that's not what I want
[22:38] <ponies> It seems like whenever I use ccsm to configure unity, unity becomes unusable that same day. The X - and [] buttons freeze the desktop, certain animations stop working, and even sometimes the decorator disappears.
[22:38] <lordcirth> cdorsal, try 'ifconfig eth0 promisc'
[22:38] <lordcirth> or whatever your interface is
[22:39] <Bashing-om> mundus2018: Do not know yet, Per ATI " OPENGL 3.2 SUPPORT  Yes " .
[22:40] <cdorsal> @lordcirth I have tried that as well. I want to be able to see all udp traffic on the same subnet. both systems are using 172.16.X.X
[22:40] <Alex_Cooper> Hello I am having alot of issues installing and using ubuntu 16.10
[22:40] <lordcirth> cdorsal, you should try asking on #ubuntu-server.  There are networking experts there
[22:40] <cdorsal> @lordcirth will do, thanks!
[22:41] <ponies> 10 is out now? I thought we're on 04.
[22:41] <Alex_Cooper> If I boot the live dvd normally for install I get a black screen and have to do nomodeset
[22:41] <lordcirth> ponies, 16.10 is out, yes
[22:41] <ponies> Is it testing or the official release?
[22:41] <Alex_Cooper> The official
[22:41] <ponies> kewl.
[22:41] <gavit> can someone help me set up a custom route for a second interface? I have written: up ip route add 172.16.68.0/24 via 192.168.16.1
[22:41] <Alex_Cooper> I found out it has to do with the kernel
[22:42] <gavit> but it seems the route doesnt get added
[22:42] <Alex_Cooper> But then there seems to be an issue with my tethered mobile phone now
[22:42] <Alex_Cooper> I cant use it to connect to the net in 16.10 and constantly reboots
[22:42] <Alex_Cooper> Its a samsung rugby 4
[22:43] <lordcirth> Alex_Cooper, tethering is tricky.
[22:43] <ponies> I tried do-release-upgrade, but it says "No new release found."
[22:43] <Alex_Cooper> Well it works fine in all previous versions of ubuntu
[22:44] <Alex_Cooper> Normally ubuntu detects and uses my phone just fine.. apparently something has changed in 16.10 that is forcing it to power cycle.. I just wish I knew what it was
[22:45] <Alex_Cooper> As it stands it has me deeply worried because 16.04.1 will eventually lose support and if it isnt fixed by that time I wont be able to use ubuntu
[22:46] <Alex_Cooper> Any help you could provide lordcirth would be very appreciated that I can assure you
[22:46] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: 16.04.1 is supported for the life of 16.04
[22:47] <drkjstr> gavit, I think you might have the command off a little bit. Try this page: http://www.cloudibee.com/static-route-linux/
[22:47] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Support?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=16.04.x+Ubuntu+Kernel+Support+Schedule.svg
[22:47] <lordcirth> Alex_Cooper, is the phone or the PC power cycling?
[22:47] <Alex_Cooper> The phone is power cycling
[22:47] <ponies> Oh. I see why do-release-upgrade isn't working.
[22:47] <lordcirth> Alex_Cooper, the simplest solution may indeed be to stay with 16.04.
[22:47] <Alex_Cooper> All my other usb devices work fine though just the phone
[22:48] <ponies> I use ubuntu server with Unity installed.
[22:48] <ponies> Not the actual Ubuntu Desktop.
[22:48] <Alex_Cooper> But what happens once support is gone for ubuntu 16.04
[22:48] <Alex_Cooper> That is what worries me
[22:48] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: you mean in 4 years?
[22:48] <Alex_Cooper> Yes
[22:48] <gavit> drkjstr: that's centos/rhel it looks like
[22:49] <nacc> ponies: see /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
[22:49] <ponies> nacc: yeah. In 4 years, the whole world is going to fall a part and get sucked into a black hole while the sun deflates into a spinning disk as soon as 16.04 is no longer supported.
[22:49] <nacc> ponies: did you tell release upgrade to allow non-lts? by default it only has lts enabled (see /etc/
[22:49] <drkjstr> you can still do route add in ubuntu. I did a route --help and it is part of 16.04
[22:49] <ponies> Not sure I did.
[22:49] <Alex_Cooper> Another issue with sticking with 16.04 is that I will not receive any of the latest software/performance enhancements
[22:50] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: if you want, file a bug, stay on 16.04 until it's fixed
[22:50] <Alex_Cooper> Which would be terrible I would love to be able to report this so it can be fixed
[22:50] <nacc> !bug | Alex_Cooper
[22:50] <ubottu> Alex_Cooper: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please report it using the command <unconvertable> ubuntu-bug <package> <unconvertable> - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[22:50] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: so report it?
[22:51] <Alex_Cooper> Hmm can I report the bug from 16.04.1?
[22:51] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: yes, why not?
[22:52] <Alex_Cooper> Well I wasn't sure I have never reported a bug before I didnt know if they needed debug data etc
[22:52] <nacc> Alex_Cooper: they probably will, but you can report it still
[22:53] <Alex_Cooper> Honestly that should be a good sign first bit of problems I have ever had using ubuntu
[22:53] <Alex_Cooper> I could consider myself lucky or ubuntu very rock solid
[22:53] <nacc> not mutually exclusive :)
[22:55] <Alex_Cooper> Once xubuntu gets their renderer switched over to opengl rather then xrender I will probably move back to that DE as well
[22:55] <Alex_Cooper> I love the simplicity of XFCE
[22:59] <gavit> I am trying to add a line like 'https://gist.github.com/gavit/9455e71d434d303be4fc750955128b0c#file-network_interfaces-L19'
[22:59] <borei> hi all
[23:00] <borei> completely confused, i have init process with 8Mb/sec write IO flat
[23:00] <borei> getting numbers from pidstat
[23:00] <borei> what init can do with disk IO ?
[23:00] <borei> ubuntu 14
[23:01] <root____5> Oi
[23:03] <drkjstr> gavit, so you have that in your /etc/network/interfaces file?
[23:04] <gavit> drkjstr: well, without the #
=== ubuntuforever100 is now known as devops4ever100yr
[23:06] <gavit> drkjstr: should line 21 be a network or just the gateway for the network?
[23:06] <lordcirth> borei, I don't see that
[23:07] <lordcirth> borei, what about iotop?  Does it show activity for pid 0?
[23:08] <gavit> drkjstr: any clue?
[23:10] <borei> lordcirth: no io from init
[23:10] <gavit> drkjstr: ip rule show does not indicate my 172.16.68.0 network :(
[23:10] <borei> but pretty high from mysql
[23:10] <lordcirth> borei, and pidstat still shows it?  Probably a pidstat bug
[23:11] <borei> pidstat points to init
[23:11] <borei> yeah seems like it's bug
[23:12] <drkjstr> good question. So the 172. is your external?
[23:13] <gavit> drkjstr: its a network that I need to reach and is connected to my 192.168.16.1
[23:13] <gavit> from 192.168.16.1 I can ping to it
[23:15] <gavit> drkjstr: basically I want to do a  route -p add outsidenetwork gw gatewaytooutsidenetwork
[23:19] <drkjstr> I can understand that. Not sure why it isn't routing. Have you tried something like this one: up route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.254
[23:19] <drkjstr> Found it over here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-route-add/
[23:21] <gavit> drkjstr: its different if you have 2 gateways :)
[23:21] <pacovc> for some reason my ubuntu is having trouble reading the universe repository..I have even switches mirrors in sources.list
[23:22] <drkjstr> I would believe it.
[23:22] <cdorsal> @lordcirth, ubuntu_server was a huge waste of time
[23:23] <cdorsal> I am trying to listen to all incoming UDP traffic from a windows system on the same subnet as my ubuntu system, but nothing appears in wireshark or tcpdump. If I listen using another windows system, I have no issues.
[23:25] <drkjstr> gavit, https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Two_Default_Gateways_on_One_System uses iproute2 as a replacement for iproute. maybe this is the solution? It is in the repositories.
[23:27] <Bashing-om> pacovc: Show the channel the error condition in a pastebin site - what returns ' sudo apt update ' ?
[23:28] <pacovc> i think I got it back on..for someone some of the mirrors don't want to work
[23:28] <pacovc> for some reason i mean
[23:30] <gavit> drkjstr: if i traceroute to it, it sees to use my public gateway :(
[23:31] <drkjstr> I wonder if that is because it needs a second routing table like expressed in the last link... ?
[23:31] <gavit> drkjstr: i hav a second one...
[23:32] <drkjstr> hmmm...
[23:37] <drkjstr> gavit, this is for a really old version of ubuntu, but might still be relavent, if you haven't see it yet: http://askubuntu.com/questions/310355/networking-with-multiple-nics
[23:49] <Kireji> it bugs me so much that ubuntu now runs "/lib/systemd/systemd --user" and "(sd-pam)" as "me"/with my user account when I didn't run them.  it feels wrong the system would run things as a user
[23:52] <anom> Hai, could someone do "xgamma" in terminal, and lemme know the default values.
[23:52] <anom> trying to fix a laptop, i think the dude has been pissing about with this setting, but dunno what the default is
[23:52] <anom> i assume it's 1.000?
[23:54] <drkjstr> anom, mine are all 1.000 for RGB.
[23:54] <brainwash> anom: wouldn't a simple relog or reboot reset the values?
[23:56] <brainwash> Kireji: you could disable that behavior
[23:56] <anom> Cheers. Reboot didn't fix the issue. :P Will check out the relog
[23:56] <Bashing-om> anom: " sysop@1404mini:~$ xgamma >> -> Red  1.000, Green  1.000, Blue  1.000 . From the man page "  Note  that  the xgamma utility is obsolete and deficient, xrandr should be used with drivers that support the XRandr extension. " .
[23:57] <anom> oh. ty
[23:57] <anom> right, xgamma sorted. must be a brightness issue ha
